> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure CLI commands in this article __require__ the `azure-cli-ml`, or 1.0, extension for Azure Machine Learning. The enhanced 2.0 CLI (preview) using the `ml` extension is now available and recommended. The extensions are incompatible, so 2.0 CLI commands will not work for the steps in this article. However, machine learning workspaces and all underlying resources can be interacted with from either, meaning one user can create a workspace with the 1.0 CLI and another can submit jobs to the same workspace with the 2.0 CLI.
>
> To find which extensions you have installed, use `az extension list`. If the list of __Extensions__ contains `azure-cli-ml`, you have the correct extension for the steps in this article.
>
> For more information on installing and using the different extensions, see the following articles:
