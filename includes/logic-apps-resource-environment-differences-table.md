| **Logic App (Consumption)** <p><p>Host environment: Multi-tenant | - Easiest to get started <p><p>- Pay-for-what-you-use <p><p>- Fully managed | A single logic app can have *only one* workflow. <p><p>Logic apps created by customers *across multiple tenants* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. | [Consumption](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#consumption-pricing) (pay-per-use) | Azure Logic Apps manages the default values for these limits, but you can change some of these values, if that option exists for a specific limit. |
| **Logic App (Standard)** <p><p>Host environment: <br>Single-tenant | - Run anywhere that Azure Functions can run using the containerized single-tenant Azure Logic Apps runtime. Deployment slots are currently not supported. <p><p>- More built-in connectors for higher throughput and lower costs at scale <p><p>- More control and fine-tuning capability around runtime and performance settings <p><p>- Integrated support for virtual networks and private endpoints. <p><p>- Create your own built-in connectors. | A single logic app can have multiple [*stateful* and *stateless*](../articles/logic-apps/single-tenant-overview-compare.md#stateful-stateless) workflows. <p><p>Workflows *in a single logic app and tenant* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. | [Standard](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#standard-pricing), based on a hosting plan with a selected pricing tier <p><p>If you run *stateful* workflows, which use [external storage](../articles/azure-functions/storage-considerations.md#storage-account-requirements), the Azure Logic Apps runtime makes storage transactions that follow [Azure Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/). | You can change the default values for many limits, based on your scenario's needs. <p><p>**Important**: Some limits have hard upper maximums. In Visual Studio Code, the changes you make to the default limit values in your logic app project configuration files won't appear in the designer experience. For more information, see [Edit app and environment settings for logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](../articles/logic-apps/edit-app-settings-host-settings.md). |
| **Logic App (Consumption)** <p><p>Host environment: <br>Integration service environment (ISE) | - Enterprise scale for large workloads <p><p>- 20+ ISE-specific connectors that connect directly to virtual networks <p><p>- Predictable pricing with included usage and customer-controlled scaling | A single logic app can have *only one* workflow. <p><p>Logic apps *in the same environment* share the same processing (compute), storage, network, and so on. | [ISE](../articles/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md#fixed-pricing) (fixed) | Azure Logic Apps manages the default values for these limits, but you can change some of these values, if that option exists for a specific limit. |
