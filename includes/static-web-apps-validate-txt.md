#### Validate TXT record

1. Return to the _Validate + configure_ screen in the Azure portal.

During this step, Azure automatically verifies the TXT record with your DNS provider. Once the validation process is complete, a green indicator appears next to the added domain.

When the green indicator appears next to your domain in the _Custom domains_ screen, you can complete the second step, which is to add an ALIAS record if you are adding a root domain or a CNAME record if you are adding a subdomain.
