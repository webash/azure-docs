# Used by Azure AD B2C app integration articles under "App integration".

After authenticating, the user navigates to a page that invokes a protected web API with bearer token authentication. The bearer token is the access token that obtained from Azure AD B2C. The app passes the token in the authorization header of the HTTPS request. 
    
```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

If the access token scope doesn't match the web API scopes, the authentication library obtains a new access token with the correct scopes.
