> [!NOTE]
> If you need to distribute identical container images across multiple Azure regions, Azure Container Registry also supports [geo-replication](../articles/container-registry/container-registry-geo-replication.md). By geo-replicating a registry (Premium service tier required), you can serve multiple regions with identical image and tag names from a single registry.
