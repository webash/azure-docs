## Create the cloud components

### Create the IoT Central application

There are several ways to connect devices to Azure IoT. In this section, you learn how to connect a device by using Azure IoT Central. IoT Central is an IoT application platform that reduces the cost and complexity of creating and managing IoT solutions.

To create a new application:
1. From [Azure IoT Central portal](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/), select **Build** on the side navigation menu.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have an existing IoT Central application, you can use it to complete the steps in this article rather than create a new application. In this case, we recommend that you either create a new device or delete and recreate the device if you want to use an existing device ID.

1. Select **Create app** in the **Custom app** tile.

1. Add Application Name and a URL.
1. Choose the **Free** Pricing plan to activate a 7-day trial.

1. Select **Create**. After IoT Central provisions the application, it redirects you automatically to the new application dashboard.


### Create a new device

In this section, you use the IoT Central application dashboard to create a new device. You will use the connection information for the newly created device to securely connect your physical device in a later section.

To create a device:
1. From the application dashboard, select **Devices** on the side navigation menu.
1. Select **Create a device** from the **All devices** pane to open the **Create a new device** window. (If you're reusing an existing application that already has one or more devices, select **+ New** to open the window.)
1. Leave Device template as **Unassigned**.
1. Fill in the desired Device name and Device ID.

1. Select the **Create** button.
1. The newly created device will appear in the **All devices** list.  Select on the device name to show details.
1. Select **Connect** in the top right menu bar to display the connection information used to configure the device in the next section.

1. Note the connection values for the following connection string parameters displayed in **Connect** dialog. You'll add these values to a configuration file in the next step:

    * `ID scope`
    * `Device ID`
    * `Primary key`
