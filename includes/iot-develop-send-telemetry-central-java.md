## Prerequisites
- A development machine with Java SE Development Kit 8 or later. You can download the Java 8 (LTS) JDK for multiple platforms from [Download Zulu Builds of OpenJDK](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/). In the installer, select the **Add to Path** option.
- [Apache Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). After you extract the download to a local folder, add the full path to the Maven */bin* folder to the Windows PATH variable.
- A local copy of the [Microsoft Azure IoT SDKs for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java) GitHub repository. Download a copy of the repository and extract it: [Download ZIP](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

## Run a simulated device
In this section, you configure your local environment, install the Azure IoT Java device SDK, and run a sample that creates a simulated temperature controller.

### Configure your environment

1. Open a console using Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Bash.

1. Set the following environment variables, using the appropriate commands for your console. The simulated device uses these values to connect to IoT Central. For `IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ID_SCOPE`, `IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_KEY`, and `IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_ID`, use the device connection values that you saved previously.

    **Windows CMD**

    ```console
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE=DPS
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ID_SCOPE=<application ID scope>
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_KEY=<device primary key>
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_ID=<your device ID>
    set IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ENDPOINT=global.azure-devices-provisioning.net
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For Windows CMD there are no quotation marks surrounding the variable values.

    **PowerShell**

    ```azurepowershell
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE='DPS'
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ID_SCOPE='<application ID scope>'
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_KEY='<device primary key>'
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_ID='<your device ID>'
    $env:IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ENDPOINT='global.azure-devices-provisioning.net'
    ```

    **Bash**

    ```bash
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_SECURITY_TYPE='DPS'
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ID_SCOPE='<application ID scope>'
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_KEY='<device primary key>'
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_DEVICE_ID='<your device ID>'
    export IOTHUB_DEVICE_DPS_ENDPOINT='global.azure-devices-provisioning.net' 
    ```

### Build and run the code

1. On Windows, navigate to the root folder of the Azure SDK for Java that you downloaded, and run the following command to build the sample.

    ```console
    cd azure-iot-sdk-java
    mvn install -T 2C -DskipTests
    ```

1. Navigate to the samples directory.
    ```console
    cd device/iot-device-samples/pnp-device-sample/temperature-controller-device-sample
    ```

1. In your console, run the following code sample. The sample creates a simulated temperature controller with thermostat sensors.
    ```console
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="samples.com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot.device.TemperatureController"
    ```

    After your simulated device connects to your IoT Central application, it connects to the device instance you created in the application and begins to send telemetry. After some initial provisioning details, the console start to output the telemetry for the temperature controller.
