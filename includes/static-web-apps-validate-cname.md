#### Validate CNAME

1. Return to the _Validate + add_ window in the Azure portal.

1. Select the **Add** button.

Azure will attempt to validate the new CNAME with your domain provider. This may take a few minutes depending on your domain provider. If the validation fails immediately, wait a few minutes and try again before proceeding with any troubleshooting.

Now that the subdomain is configured, it may take several hours for the DNS provider to propagate the changes worldwide.
