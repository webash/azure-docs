# Troubleshoot issues with diagnostics queries

In this article, we'll cover how to write simple queries to help troubleshoot issues with your Azure Cosmos DB account using diagnostics logs sent to **AzureDiagnostics (legacy)** and **Resource-specific (preview)** tables.

For Azure Diagnostics tables, all data is written into one single table and users will need to specify which category they'd like to query.

For resource-specific tables (currently in preview for SQL API), data is written into individual tables for each category of the resource. We recommend this mode since it makes it much easier to work with the data, provides better discoverability of the schemas, and improves performance across both ingestion latency and query times.

- How to query for the operations that are taking longer than 3 milliseconds to run:

   ```Kusto
   AzureDiagnostics 
   | where toint(duration_s) > 3 and ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB" and Category=="DataPlaneRequests" 
   | summarize count() by clientIpAddress_s, TimeGenerated
   ```

- How to query for the user agent that is running the operations:

   ```Kusto
   AzureDiagnostics 
   | where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB" and Category=="DataPlaneRequests" 
   | summarize count() by OperationName, userAgent_s
   ```

   | project TimeGenerated , duration_s 
   | summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 5s)
   | render timechart
   ```
