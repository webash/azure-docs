# Diagnose and troubleshoot Azure Cosmos DB request rate too large (429) exceptions
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql-api](includes/appliesto-sql-api.md)]

This article contains known causes and solutions for various 429 status code errors for the SQL API. If you are using the API for MongoDB, see the [Troubleshoot common issues in API for MongoDB](mongodb-troubleshoot.md) article for how to debug status code 16500.

A "Request rate too large" exception, also known as error code 429, indicates that your requests against Azure Cosmos DB are being rate limited.

When you use provisioned throughput, you set the throughput measured in request units per second (RU/s) required for your workload. Database operations against the service such as reads, writes, and queries consume some amount of request units (RUs). Learn more about [request units](request-units.md).

In a given second, if the operations consume more than the provisioned request units, Azure Cosmos DB will return a 429 exception. Each second, the number of request units available to use is reset.

Before taking an action to change the RU/s, it's important to understand the root cause of rate limiting and address the underlying issue.  

There are different error messages that correspond to different types of 429 exceptions:
- [Request rate is large. More Request Units may be needed, so no changes were made.](#request-rate-is-large)
- [The request did not complete due to a high rate of metadata requests.](#rate-limiting-on-metadata-requests)
- [The request did not complete due to a transient service error.](#rate-limiting-due-to-transient-service-error)


## Request rate is large
This is the most common scenario. It occurs when the request units consumed by operations on data exceed the provisioned number of RU/s. 

### Step 1: Check the metrics to determine the percentage of requests with 429 error
Seeing 429 error messages doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem with your database or container.

#### How to investigate

Determine what percent of your requests to your database or container resulted in 429s, compared to the overall count of successful requests. From your Azure Cosmos DB account blade, navigate to **Insights** > **Requests** > **Total Requests by Status Code**. Filter to a specific database and container. 

By default, the Azure Cosmos DB client SDKs and data import tools such as Azure Data Factory and bulk executor library automatically retry requests on 429s. They retry typically up to 9 times. As a result, while you may see 429s in the metrics, these errors may not even have been returned to your application.

#### Recommended solution
In general, for a production workload, if you see between 1-5% of requests with 429s, and your end to end latency is acceptable, this is a healthy sign that the RU/s are being fully utilized. No action is required. Otherwise, move to the next troubleshooting steps.

### Step 2: Determine if there is a hot partition
A hot partition arises when one or a few logical partition keys consume a disproportionate amount of the total RU/s due to higher request volume. This can be caused by a partition key design that doesn't evenly distribute requests. It results in many requests being directed to a small subset of logical (which implies physical) partitions that become "hot." Because all data for a logical partition resides on one physical partition and total RU/s is evenly distributed among the physical partitions, a hot partition can lead to 429s and inefficient use of throughput. 

Here are some examples of partitioning strategies that lead to hot partitions:
- You have a container storing IoT device data for a write-heavy workload that is partitioned by date. All data for a single date will reside on the same logical and physical partition. Because all the data written each day has the same date, this would result in a hot partition every day. 
    - Instead, for this scenario, a partition key like id (either a GUID or device id), or a [synthetic partition key](./synthetic-partition-keys.md) combining id and date would yield a higher cardinality of values and better distribution of request volume.
- You have a multi-tenant scenario with a container partitioned by tenantId. If one tenant is significantly more active than the others, it results in a hot partition. For example, if the largest tenant has 100,000 users, but most tenants have fewer than 10 users, you will have a hot partition when partitioned by the tenantID. 
    - For this previous scenario, consider having a dedicated container for the largest tenant, partitioned by a more granular property such as UserId. 
    
#### How to identify the hot partition

To verify if there is a hot partition, navigate to **Insights** > **Throughput** > **Normalized RU Consumption (%) By PartitionKeyRangeID**. Filter to a specific database and container. 

Each PartitionKeyRangeId maps to a one physical partition. If there is one PartitionKeyRangeId that has significantly higher Normalized RU consumption than others (for example, one is consistently at 100%, but others are at 30% or less), this can be a sign of a hot partition. Learn more about the [Normalized RU Consumption metric](monitor-normalized-request-units.md).

To see which logical partition keys are consuming the most RU/s, 
use [Azure Diagnostic Logs](cosmosdb-monitor-resource-logs.md). This sample query sums up the total request units consumed per second on each logical partition key. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling diagnostic logs incurs a separate charge for the Log Analytics service, which is billed based on volume of data ingested. It is recommended you turn on diagnostic logs for a limited amount of time for debugging, and turn off when no longer required. See [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) for details.

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(24hour)
| where Category == "PartitionKeyRUConsumption"
| where collectionName_s == "CollectionName" 
| where isnotempty(partitionKey_s)
// Sum total request units consumed by logical partition key for each second
| summarize sum(todouble(requestCharge_s)) by partitionKey_s, operationType_s, bin(TimeGenerated, 1s)
| order by sum_requestCharge_s desc
```
This sample output shows that in a particular minute, the logical partition key with value "Contoso" consumed around 12,000 RU/s, while the logical partition key with value "Fabrikam" consumed less than 600 RU/s. If this pattern was consistent during the time period where rate limiting occurred, this would indicate a hot partition.

> [!TIP]
> In any workload, there will be natural variation in request volume across logical partitions. You should determine if the hot partition is caused by a fundamental skewness due to choice of partition key (which may require changing the key) or temporary spike due to natural variation in workload patterns.

#### Recommended solution
Review the guidance on [how to chose a good partition key](./partitioning-overview.md#choose-partitionkey).

If there is high percent of rate limited requests and no hot partition:
- You can [increase the RU/s](set-throughput.md) on the database or container using the client SDKs, Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI or ARM template.  

If there is high percent of rate limited requests and there is an underlying hot partition:
-  Long-term, for best cost and performance, consider **changing the partition key**. The partition key cannot be updated in place, so this requires migrating the data to a new container with a different partition key. Azure Cosmos DB supports a [live data migration tool](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/how-to-change-your-partition-key/) for this purpose.
- Short-term, you can temporarily increase the RU/s to allow more throughput to the hot partition. This is not recommended as a long-term strategy, as it leads to overprovisioning RU/s and higher cost. 

> [!TIP]
>  When you increase the throughput, the scale-up operation will either complete instantaneously or require up to 5-6 hours to complete, depending on the number of RU/s you want to scale up to. If you want to know the highest number of RU/s you can set without triggering the asynchronous scale-up operation (which requires Azure Cosmos DB to provision more physical partitions), multiply the number of distinct PartitionKeyRangeIds by 10,0000 RU/s. For example, if you have 30,000 RU/s provisioned and 5 physical partitions (6000 RU/s allocated per physical partition), you can increase to 50,000 RU/s (10,000 RU/s per physical partition) in an instantaneous scale-up operation. Increasing to >50,000 RU/s would require an asynchronous scale-up operation.

### Step 3: Determine what requests are returning 429s

#### How to investigate requests with 429s
Use [Azure Diagnostic Logs](cosmosdb-monitor-resource-logs.md) to identify which requests are returning 429s and how many RUs they consumed. This sample query aggregates at the minute level. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling diagnostic logs incurs a separate charge for the Log Analytics service, which is billed based on volume of data ingested. It is recommended you turn on diagnostic logs for a limited amount of time for debugging, and turn off when no longer required. See [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) for details.

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(24h)
| where Category == "DataPlaneRequests"
| summarize throttledOperations = dcountif(activityId_g, statusCode_s == 429), totalOperations = dcount(activityId_g), totalConsumedRUPerMinute = sum(todouble(requestCharge_s)) by databaseName_s, collectionName_s, OperationName, requestResourceType_s, bin(TimeGenerated, 1min)
| extend averageRUPerOperation = 1.0 * totalConsumedRUPerMinute / totalOperations 
| extend fractionOf429s = 1.0 * throttledOperations / totalOperations
| order by fractionOf429s desc
```
For example, this sample output shows that each minute, 30% of Create Document requests were being rate limited, with each request consuming an average of 17 RUs.
:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-request-rate-too-large/throttled-requests-diagnostic-logs-results.png" alt-text="Requests with 429 in Diagnostic Logs.":::

#### Recommended solution
##### 429s on create, replace, or upsert document requests
- By default, in the SQL API, all properties are indexed by default. Tune the [indexing policy](index-policy.md) to only index the properties needed.
This will lower the Request Units required per create document operation, which will reduce the likelihood of seeing 429s or allow you to achieve higher operations per second for the same amount of provisioned RU/s. 

##### 429s on query document requests
- Follow the guidance to [troubleshoot queries with high RU charge](troubleshoot-query-performance.md#querys-ru-charge-is-too-high)

##### 429s on execute stored procedures
- [Stored procedures](stored-procedures-triggers-udfs.md) are intended for operations that require write transactions across a partition key value. It is not recommended to use stored procedures for a large number of read or query operations. For best performance, these read or query operations should be done on the client-side, using the Cosmos SDKs. 

## Rate limiting on metadata requests

Metadata rate limiting can occur when you are performing a high volume of metadata operations on databases and/or containers. Metadata operations include:
- Create, read, update, or delete a container or database
- List databases or containers in a Cosmos account
- Query for offers to see the current provisioned throughput 

There is a system-reserved RU limit for these operations, so increasing the provisioned RU/s of the database or container will have no impact and is not recommended. See [limits on metadata operations](concepts-limits.md#metadata-request-limits).

#### How to investigate
Navigate to **Insights** > **System** > **Metadata Requests By Status Code**. Filter to a specific database and container if desired. 

:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-request-rate-too-large/metadata-throttling-insights.png" alt-text="Metadata requests by status code chart in Insights.":::

#### Recommended solution
- If your application needs to perform metadata operations, consider implementing a backoff policy to send these requests at a lower rate. 

- Use static Cosmos DB client instances. When the DocumentClient or CosmosClient is initialized, the Cosmos DB SDK fetches metadata on about the account, including information about the consistency level, databases, containers, partitions, and offers. This initialization may consume a high number of RUs, and should be performed infrequently. Use a single DocumentClient instance and use it for the lifetime of your application.

- Cache the names of databases and containers. Retrieve the names of your databases and containers from configuration or cache them on start. Calls like ReadDatabaseAsync/ReadDocumentCollectionAsync or CreateDatabaseQuery/CreateDocumentCollectionQuery will result in metadata calls to the service, which consume from the system-reserved RU limit. These operations should be performed infrequently.

## Rate limiting due to transient service error

This 429 error is returned when the request encounters a transient service error. Increasing the RU/s on the database or container will have no impact and is not recommended.

#### Recommended solution
Retry the request. If the error persists for several minutes, file a support ticket from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
