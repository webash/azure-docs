# How to configure the Azure Cosmos DB integrated cache (Preview)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql-api](includes/appliesto-sql-api.md)]

This article describes how to provision a dedicated gateway, configure the integrated cache, and connect your application. 

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide.md#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
- An existing application that uses Azure Cosmos DB. If you don't have one, [here are some examples](https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/labs).
- An existing [Azure Cosmos DB SQL (core) API account](create-cosmosdb-resources-portal.md).

## Provision a dedicated gateway cluster

1. Navigate to an Azure Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal and select the **Dedicated Gateway** tab.

2. Fill out the **Dedicated gateway** form with the following details:

   * **Dedicated Gateway** - Turn on the  toggle to **Provisioned**. 
   * **SKU** - Select a SKU with the required compute and memory size. 
   *  **Number of instances** - Number of nodes. For development purpose, we recommend starting with one node of the D4 size. Based on the amount of data you need to cache, you can increase the node size after initial testing.

3. Select **Save** and wait about 5-10 minutes for the dedicated gateway provisioning to complete. When the provisioning is done, you'll see the following notification:

## Configuring the integrated cache

1. When you create a dedicated gateway, an integrated cache is automatically provisioned. The integrated cache will use approximately 70% of the memory in the dedicated gateway. The remaining 30% of memory in the dedicated gateway is used for routing requests to the backend partitions.

2.	Modify your application's connection string to use the new dedicated gateway endpoint.

      The updated dedicated gateway connection string is in the **Keys** blade:
   
      :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-configure-integrated-cache/dedicated-gateway-connection-string.png" alt-text="An image that shows the dedicated gateway connection string" lightbox="./media/how-to-configure-integrated-cache/dedicated-gateway-connection-string.png" border="false":::

      All dedicated gateway connection strings follow the same pattern. Remove `documents.azure.com` from your original connection string and replace it with `sqlx.cosmos.azure.com`. A dedicated gateway will always have the same connection string, even if you remove and reprovision it.

      You don’t need to modify the connection string in all applications using the same Azure Cosmos DB account. For example, you could have one `CosmosClient` connect using gateway mode and the dedicated gateway endpoint while another `CosmosClient` uses direct mode. In other words, adding a dedicated gateway doesn't impact the existing ways of connecting to Azure Cosmos DB.

3. If you're using the .NET or Java SDK, set the connection mode to [gateway mode](sql-sdk-connection-modes.md#available-connectivity-modes). This step isn't necessary for the Python and Node.js SDKs since they don't have additional options of connecting besides gateway mode.

## Adjust request consistency

You must adjust the request consistency to eventual. If not, the request will always bypass the integrated cache. The easiest way to configure eventual consistency for all read operations is to [set it at the account-level](consistency-levels.md#configure-the-default-consistency-level). You can also configure consistency at the [request-level](how-to-manage-consistency.md#override-the-default-consistency-level), which is recommended if you only want a subset of your reads to utilize the integrated cache.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the Python SDK, you **must** explicitly set the consistency level for each request. The default account-level setting will not automatically apply.

## Adjust MaxIntegratedCacheStaleness

Configure `MaxIntegratedCacheStaleness`, which is the maximum time in which you are willing to tolerate stale cached data. We recommend setting the `MaxIntegratedCacheStaleness` as high as possible because it will increase the likelihood that repeated point reads and queries can be cache hits. If you set `MaxIntegratedCacheStaleness` to 0, your read request will **never** use the integrated cache, regardless of the consistency level. When not configured, the default `MaxIntegratedCacheStaleness` is 5 minutes.

**.NET**

```csharp
FeedIterator<Food> myQuery = container.GetItemQueryIterator<Food>(new QueryDefinition("SELECT * FROM c"), requestOptions: new QueryRequestOptions
        {
            ConsistencyLevel = ConsistencyLevel.Eventual,
            DedicatedGatewayRequestOptions = new DedicatedGatewayRequestOptions 
            { 
                MaxIntegratedCacheStaleness = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30) 
            }
        }
);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you can only adjust the MaxIntegratedCacheStaleness using the latest .NET and Java preview SDK's.

## Verify cache hits

Finally, you can restart your application and verify integrated cache hits for repeated point reads or queries. Once you’ve modified your `CosmosClient` to use the dedicated gateway endpoint, all requests will be routed through the dedicated gateway.

For a read request (point read or query) to utilize the integrated cache, **all** of the following criteria must be true:

-	Your client connects to the dedicated gateway endpoint
-  Your client uses gateway mode (Python and Node.js SDK's always use gateway mode)
-	The consistency for the request must be set to eventual.
