   API|Gremlin (graph)|The API determines the type of account to create. Azure Cosmos DB provides five APIs: Core (SQL) for document databases, Gremlin for graph databases, MongoDB for document databases, Azure Table, and Cassandra. You must create a separate account for each API. <br><br>Select **Gremlin (graph)**, because in this quickstart you are creating a table that works with the Gremlin API. <br><br>[Learn more about the Gremlin API](../graph-introduction.md).|
   |Location|The region closest to your users|Select a geographic location to host your Azure Cosmos DB account. Use the location that is closest to your users to give them the fastest access to the data.|

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can have up to one free tier Azure Cosmos DB account per Azure subscription and must opt-in when creating the account. If you do not see the option to apply the free tier discount, this means another account in the subscription has already been enabled with free tier.
