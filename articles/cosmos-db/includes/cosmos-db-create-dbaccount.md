1. On the **Azure Cosmos DB** page, select **Create**.

1. In the **Create Azure Cosmos DB Account** page, enter the basic settings for the new Azure Cosmos account.

   |Setting|Value|Description |
   |---|---|---|
   |Subscription|Subscription name|Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for this Azure Cosmos account. |
   |Resource Group|Resource group name|Select a resource group, or select **Create new**, then enter a unique name for the new resource group. |
   |Account Name|A unique name|Enter a name to identify your Azure Cosmos account. Because *documents.azure.com* is appended to the name that you provide to create your URI, use a unique name.<br><br>The name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character. It must be between 3-31 characters in length.|
   |API|The type of account to create|Select **Core (SQL)** to create a document database and query by using SQL syntax. <br><br>The API determines the type of account to create. Azure Cosmos DB provides five APIs: Core (SQL) and MongoDB for document data, Gremlin for graph data, Azure Table, and Cassandra. Currently, you must create a separate account for each API. <br><br>[Learn more about the SQL API](../introduction.md).|
   |Location|The region closest to your users|Select a geographic location to host your Azure Cosmos DB account. Use the location that is closest to your users to give them the fastest access to the data.|
   |Capacity mode|Provisioned throughput or Serverless|Select **Provisioned throughput** to create an account in [provisioned throughput](../set-throughput.md) mode. Select **Serverless** to create an account in [serverless](../serverless.md) mode.|
   |Apply Azure Cosmos DB free tier discount|**Apply** or **Do not apply**|With Azure Cosmos DB free tier, you will get the first 1000 RU/s and 25 GB of storage for free in an account. Learn more about [free tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db/).|

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can have up to one free tier Azure Cosmos DB account per Azure subscription and must opt-in when creating the account. If you do not see the option to apply the free tier discount, this means another account in the subscription has already been enabled with free tier.

   * **Backup Policy** - Configure either [periodic](../configure-periodic-backup-restore.md) or [continuous](../continuous-backup-restore-portal.md) backup policy.
   * **Encryption** - Use either service-managed key or a [customer-managed key](../how-to-setup-cmk.md#create-a-new-azure-cosmos-account).
   * **Tags** - Tags are name/value pairs that enable you to categorize resources and view consolidated billing by applying the same tag to multiple resources and resource groups.
