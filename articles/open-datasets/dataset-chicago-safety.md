# Chicago Safety Data

311 service requests from the city of Chicago, including historical sanitation code complaints, pot holes reported, and street light issues

All open sanitation code complaints made to 311 and all requests completed since January 1, 2011. The Department of Streets and Sanitation investigates and remedies reported violations of Chicago’s sanitation code. Residents may request service for violations such as overflowing dumpsters and garbage in the alley. 311 sometimes receives duplicate sanitation code complaints. Requests that have been labeled as duplicates are in the same geographic area as a previous request and have been entered into 311’s Customer Service Request (CSR) system at around the same time. Duplicate complaints are labeled as such in the status field, as either “Open - Dup” or “Completed - Dup.”

[!INCLUDE [Open Dataset usage notice](../../includes/open-datasets-usage-note.md)]

The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center. CDOT uses a mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and schedule crews.

One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block. Pothole repairs are completed within seven days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, frigid temps, and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes. On days when weather is cooperative and there's no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes. 

If a previous request is already open for a buffer of four addresses, the request is given the status of “Duplicate (Open)”. For example, if there's an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of “Duplicate (Open)”. Once the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read “Completed” for the original request and “Duplicate (Closed)” for any duplicate requests. A service request also receives the status of “Completed” when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled. If another issue is found with the street, such as a “cave-in” or “failed utility cut”, then it's directed to the appropriate department or contractor.

All open reports of “Street Lights - All Out” (an outage of three or more lights) made to 311 and all requests completed since January 1, 2011. The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees approximately 250,000 street lights that illuminate arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT performs repairs and bulb replacements in response to residents’ reports of street light outages. Whenever CDOT receives a report of an “All Out” the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at the lights in that circuit (each circuit has 8-16 lights) to make sure they're working properly. If a second request of lights out in the same circuit is made within four calendar days of the original request, the newest request is automatically given the status of “Duplicate (Open).” Since CDOT’s electrician will be looking at the lights in a circuit to verify they're working, any “Duplicate (Open)” address will automatically be observed and repaired. Once the street lights are repaired, the status in CSR will read “Completed” for the original request and “Duplicate (Closed)” for any duplicate requests. A service request also receives the status of “Completed” when the reported lights are inspected but found to be in good repair and functioning; when the service request is for a non-existent address; or when the lights are maintained by a contractor. Data is updated daily.

## Volume and retention

This dataset is stored in Parquet format. It is updated daily, and contains about 1M rows (80 MB) in total as of 2018.

This dataset contains historical records accumulated from 2011 to 2018. You can use parameter settings in our SDK to fetch data within a specific time range.

## Storage location

This dataset is stored in the East US Azure region. Allocating compute resources in East US is recommended for affinity.
