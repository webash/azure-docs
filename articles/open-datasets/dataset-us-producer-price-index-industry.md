# US Consumer Price Index industry

The Producer Price Index (PPI) is a measure of average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The prices included in the PPI are from the first commercial transaction for products and services covered.

[!INCLUDE [Open Dataset usage notice](../../includes/open-datasets-usage-note.md)]

The Producer Price Index Revision-Current Series indexes reflect price movements for the net output of producers organized according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The PC dataset is compatible with a wide assortment of NAICS-based economic time series including: productivity, production, employment, wages, and earnings.

The PPI universe consists of the output of all industries in the goods-producing sectors of the U.S. economy- mining, manufacturing, agriculture, fishing, and forestry- as well as natural gas, electricity, construction, and goods competitive with those made in the producing sectors, such as waste and scrap materials. In addition, as of January 2011, the PPI program covered more than three-quarters of the service sectorâ€™s output, publishing data for selected industries in the following industry sectors: wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; information; finance and insurance; real estate brokering, rental, and leasing; professional, scientific, and technical services; administrative, support, and waste management services; health care and social assistance; and accommodation.
