# 1000 Genomes

The 1000 Genomes Project ran between 2008 and 2015, creating the largest public catalog of human variation and genotype data. The final data set contains data for 2,504 individuals from 26 populations and 84 million identified variants. For more information, see the 1000 Genome Project website and the following publications:

Pilot Analysis: A map of human genome variation from population-scale sequencing Nature 467, 1061-1073 (28 October 2010)

Phase 1 Analysis: An integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes Nature 491, 56-65 (01 November 2012)

Phase 3 Analysis: A global reference for human genetic variation Nature 526, 68-74 (01 October 2015) and An integrated map of structural variation in 2,504 human genomes Nature 526, 75-81 (01 October 2015)
