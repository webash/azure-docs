# Credentials for source authentication in Azure Purview

This article describes how you can create credentials in Azure Purview. These saved credentials let you quickly reuse and apply saved authentication information to your data source scans.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure key vault. To learn how to create one, see [Quickstart: Create a key vault using the Azure portal](../key-vault/general/quick-create-portal.md).

## Introduction

A credential is authentication information that Azure Purview can use to authenticate to your registered data sources. A credential object can be created for various types of authentication scenarios, such as Basic Authentication requiring username/password. Credential capture specific information required to authenticate, based on the chosen type of authentication method. Credentials use your existing Azure Key Vaults secrets for retrieving sensitive authentication information during the Credential creation process.

In Azure Purview, there are few options to use as authentication method to scan data sources such as the following options:

- Azure Purview Managed Identity
- Account Key (using Key Vault)
- SQL Authentication (using Key Vault)
- Service Principal (using Key Vault)

Before creating any credentials, consider your data source types and networking requirements to decide which authentication method is needed for your scenario. Review the following decision tree to find which credential is most suitable:

## Use Purview managed identity to set up scans

If you are using the Purview managed identity to set up scans, you will not have to explicitly create a credential and link your key vault to Purview to store them. For detailed instructions on adding the Purview managed identity to have access to scan your data sources, refer to the data source-specific authentication sections below:

- [Azure Blob Storage](register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source.md#setting-up-authentication-for-a-scan)
- [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](register-scan-adls-gen1.md#setting-up-authentication-for-a-scan)
- [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](register-scan-adls-gen2.md#setting-up-authentication-for-a-scan)
- [Azure SQL Database](register-scan-azure-sql-database.md)
- [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](register-scan-azure-sql-database-managed-instance.md#setting-up-authentication-for-a-scan)
- [Azure Synapse Analytics](register-scan-azure-synapse-analytics.md#setting-up-authentication-for-a-scan)

## Create Azure Key Vaults connections in your Azure Purview account

Before you can create a Credential, first associate one or more of your existing Azure Key Vault instances with your Azure Purview account.

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select your Azure Purview account and Open Azure Purview Studio. Navigate to the **Management Center** on Azure Purview Studio and then navigate to **credentials**.

2. From the **Credentials** page, select **Manage Key Vault connections**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/manage-credentials/manage-kv-connections.png" alt-text="Manage Azure Key Vault connections":::

3. Select **+ New** from the Manage Key Vault connections page.

4. Provide the required information, then select **Create**.

5. Confirm that your Key Vault has been successfully associated with your Azure Purview account as shown in this example:

## Grant the Purview managed identity access to your Azure Key Vault

Currently Azure Key Vault supports two permission models:

- Option 1 - Access Policies 
- Option 2 - Role-based Access Control 

Before assigning access to Purview managed identity, first identify your Azure Key Vault permission model from Key Vault resource **Access Policies** in the menu. Follow steps below based on relevant the permission model.  

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-credentials/akv-permission-model.png" alt-text="Azure Key Vault Permission Model"::: 

### Option 1 - Assign access using using Key Vault Access Policy  

Follow these steps only if permission model in your Azure Key Vault resource is set to **Vault Access Policy**:

1. Navigate to your Azure Key Vault.

2. Select the **Access policies** page.

3. Select **Add Access Policy**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/manage-credentials/add-msi-to-akv-2.png" alt-text="Add Purview MSI to AKV":::

4. In the **Secrets permissions** dropdown, select **Get** and **List** permissions.

5. For **Select principal**, choose the Purview managed identity. You can search for the Purview MSI using either the Purview instance name **or** the managed identity application ID. We do not currently support compound identities (managed identity name + application ID).

   :::image type="content" source="media/manage-credentials/add-access-policy.png" alt-text="Add access policy":::

6. Select **Add**.

7. Select **Save** to save the Access policy.

   :::image type="content" source="media/manage-credentials/save-access-policy.png" alt-text="Save access policy":::

### Option 2 - Assign access using Key Vault Azure role-based access control 

Follow these steps only if permission model in your Azure Key Vault resource is set to **Azure role-based access control**:

1. Navigate to your Azure Key Vault.

2. Select **Access Control (IAM)** from the left navigation menu.

3. Select **+ Add**.

4. Set the **Role** to **Key Vault Secrets User** and enter your enter your Azure Purview account name under **Select** input box. Then, select Save to give this role assignment to your Purview account.

## Create a new credential

These credential types are supported in Purview:

- Basic authentication: You add the **password** as a secret in key vault.
- Service Principal: You add the **service principal key** as a secret in key vault.
- SQL authentication: You add the **password** as a secret in key vault.
- Account Key: You add the **account key** as a secret in key vault.
- Role ARN: For an Amazon S3 data source, add your **role ARN** in AWS. 

For more information, see [Add a secret to Key Vault](../key-vault/secrets/quick-create-portal.md#add-a-secret-to-key-vault) and [Create a new AWS role for Purview](register-scan-amazon-s3.md#create-a-new-aws-role-for-purview).

After storing your secrets in the key vault:

1. In Azure Purview, go to the Credentials page.

2. Create your new Credential by selecting **+ New**.

3. Provide the required information. Select the **Authentication method** and a **Key Vault connection** from which to select a secret from.

4. Once all the details have been filled in, select **Create**.

5. Verify that your new credential shows up in the list view and is ready to use.

## Manage your key vault connections

1. Search/find Key Vault connections by name

   :::image type="content" source="media/manage-credentials/search-kv.png" alt-text="Search key vault":::

2. Delete one or more Key Vault connections

   :::image type="content" source="media/manage-credentials/delete-kv.png" alt-text="Delete key vault":::

## Manage your credentials

1. Search/find Credentials by name.
  
2. Select and make updates to an existing Credential.

3. Delete one or more Credentials.
