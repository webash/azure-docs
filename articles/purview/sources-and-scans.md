# Supported data sources and file types in Azure Purview

This article discusses supported data sources, file types and scanning concepts in Purview.

## Supported data sources

Purview supports all the data sources listed [here](purview-connector-overview.md).

## File types supported for scanning

The following file types are supported for scanning, for schema extraction and classification where applicable:

- Structured file formats supported by extension: AVRO, ORC, PARQUET, CSV, JSON, PSV, SSV, TSV, TXT, XML, GZIP
- Document file formats supported by extension: DOC, DOCM, DOCX, DOT, ODP, ODS, ODT, PDF, POT, PPS, PPSX, PPT, PPTM, PPTX, XLC, XLS, XLSB, XLSM, XLSX, XLT
- Purview also supports custom file extensions and custom parsers.
 
> [!Note]
> Every Gzip file must be mapped to a single csv file within. Gzip files are subject to System and Custom Classification rules. We currently don't support scanning a gzip file mapped to multiple files within, or any file type other than csv. Also, Purview scanner supports scanning snappy compressed PARQUET and AVRO file types for schema extraction and classification.

> [!Note]
> Purview scanner does not support complex data types in AVRO, ORC and PARQUET file types for schema extraction.   

## Sampling within a file

In Purview terminology,
- L1 scan: Extracts basic information and meta data like file name, size and fully qualified name
- L2 scan: Extracts schema for structured file types and database tables
- L3 scan: Extracts schema where applicable and subjects the sampled file to system and custom classification rules

For all structured file formats, Purview scanner samples files in the following way:

- For structured file types, it samples 128 rows in each column or 1 MB, whichever is lower.
- For document file formats, it samples 20 MB of each file.
    - If a document file is larger than 20 MB, then it is not subject to a deep scan (subject to classification). In that case, Purview captures only basic meta data like file name and fully qualified name.

## Resource set file sampling

A folder or group of partition files is detected as a *resource set* in Purview, if it matches with a system resource set policy or a customer defined resource set policy. If a resource set is detected, then Purview will sample each folder that it contains. Learn more about resource sets [here](concept-resource-sets.md).

File sampling for resource sets by file types:

- **Delimited files (CSV, PSV, SSV, TSV)** - 1 in 100 files are sampled (L3 scan) within a folder or group of partition files that are considered a 'Resource set'
- **Data Lake file types (Parquet, Avro, Orc)** - 1 in 18446744073709551615 (long max) files are sampled (L3 scan) within a folder or group of partition files that are considered a *resource set*
- **Other structured file types (JSON, XML, TXT)** - 1 in 100 files are sampled (L3 scan) within a folder or group of partition files that are considered a 'Resource set'
- **SQL objects and CosmosDB entities** - Each file is L3 scanned.
- **Document file types** - Each file is L3 scanned. Resource set patterns don't apply to these file types.

## Classification

All 105 system classification rules apply to structured file formats. Only the MCE classification rules apply to document file types (Not the data scan native regex patterns, bloom filter-based detection). For more information on supported classifications, see [Supported classifications in Azure Purview](supported-classifications.md).
