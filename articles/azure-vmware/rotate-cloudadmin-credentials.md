# Rotate the cloudadmin credentials for Azure VMware Solution

In this article, you'll rotate the cloudadmin credentials (vCenter and NSX-T credentials) for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.  Although the passwords for these accounts don't expire, you can generate new ones. After generating new passwords, you must update VMware HCX Connector with the latest credentials applied.

You can also watch a video on how to [reset the vCenter CloudAdmin & NSX-T admin password](https://youtu.be/cK1qY3knj88). 

## Prerequisites

If you use your cloudadmin credentials for connected services like HCX, vRealize Orchestrator, vRealize Operations Manager, or VMware Horizon, your connections stop working once you update your password.  Stop these services before initiating the password rotation. Otherwise, you'll experience temporary locks on your vCenter CloudAdmin and NSX-T admin accounts, as these services continuously call using your old credentials.  For more information about setting up separate accounts for connected services, see [Access and Identity Concepts](./concepts-identity.md).

## Reset your Azure VMware Solution cloudadmin credentials

In this step, you'll rotate the cloudadmin credentials for your Azure VMware Solution components. 

>[!NOTE]
>Remember to replace **{SubscriptionID}**, **{ResourceGroup}**, and **{PrivateCloudName}** with you private cloud information.

1. From the Azure portal, open an Azure Cloud Shell session.

2. Update your vCenter CloudAdmin password.  

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az resource invoke-action --action rotateVcenterPassword --ids "/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.AVS/privateClouds/{PrivateCloudName}" --api-version "2020-07-17-preview"
   ```
          
3. Update your NSX-T admin password. 

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az resource invoke-action --action rotateNSXTPassword --ids "/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.AVS/privateClouds/{PrivateCloudName}" --api-version "2020-07-17-preview"
   ```

## Update HCX Connector with the latest cloudadmin credentials

In this step, you'll update HCX Connector with the updated credentials.

1. Go to the on-premises HCX Connector at https://{ip of the HCX connector appliance}:443 and sign in using the new credentials.

   Be sure to use port 443. 

2. On the VMware HCX Dashboard, select **Site Pairing**.

3. Select the correct connection to Azure VMware Solution and select **Edit Connection**.
 
4. Provide the new vCenter Server CloudAdmin user credentials and select **Edit**, which saves the credentials. Save should show successful.
