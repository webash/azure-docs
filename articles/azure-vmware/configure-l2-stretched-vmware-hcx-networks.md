# Configure DHCP on L2 stretched VMware HCX networks

DHCP does not work for virtual machines (VMs) on the VMware HCX L2 stretch network when the DHCP server is in the on-premises datacenter.  NSX, by default, blocks all DHCP requests from traversing the L2 stretch. To send DHCP requests from your Azure VMware Solution VMs to a non-NSX-T DHCP server, you'll need to configure DHCP on L2 stretched VMware HCX networks.

1. (Optional) If you need to locate the segment name of the L2 extension:

   1. Sign in to your on-premises vCenter, and under **Home**, select **HCX**.

   1. Select **Network Extension** under **Services**.

   1. Select the network extension you want to support DHCP requests from Azure VMware Solution to on-premises.

   1. Take note of the destination network name.

1. In NSX-T Manager, select **Networking** > **Segments** > **Segment Profiles**.

1. Select **Add Segment Profile** and then **Segment Security**.

1. Provide a name and a tag, and then set the **BPDU Filter** toggle to ON and all the DHCP toggles to OFF.
