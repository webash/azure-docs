# Troubleshoot Azure Resource Manager issues on an Azure Stack Edge device 

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-and-mini-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-mini-r-sku.md)]

This article describes how to troubleshoot issues with Azure Resource Manager that may interfere with management of resources on your Azure Stack Edge device. Azure Resource Manager provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account.
 
## Azure Resource Manager configuration errors

The following errors may indicate an issue with your Azure Resource Manager configuration. 

| **Issue / Errors** |  **Resolution** |

## Troubleshoot general issues with Azure Resource Manager

For general issues with Azure Resource Manager, make sure that your device and the client are configured properly. For end-to-end procedures, see [Connect to Azure Resource Manager on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device](azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-resource-manager.md).


### Verify the device is configured properly

1. From the local UI, verify that the device network is configured correctly.

2. [Verify that certificates are updated for all the endpoints](./azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-resource-manager.md#step-2-create-and-install-certificates).

3. Get the Azure Resource Manager management and login endpoint from the **Device** page in local UI.

4. Verify that the device is activated and registered in Azure.


### Verify the client is configured properly

1. [Validate that the correct PowerShell version is installed](./azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-resource-manager.md#step-3-install-powershell-on-the-client).

2. [Validate that the correct PowerShell modules are installed](./azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-resource-manager.md#step-4-set-up-azure-powershell-on-the-client).

3. Validate that Azure Resource Manager and login endpoints are reachable. You can try to ping the endpoints. For example:

   `ping management.28bmdw2-bb9.microsoftdatabox.com`
   `ping login.28bmdw2-bb9.microsoftdatabox.com`
   
   If they aren't reachable, [add DNS / host file entries](./azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-resource-manager.md#step-5-modify-host-file-for-endpoint-name-resolution).
   
4. [Validate that client certificates are installed](./azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-resource-manager.md#import-certificates-on-the-client-running-azure-powershell).

5. If you're using PowerShell, enable the debug preference to see detailed messages by running this PowerShell command: 

    `$debugpreference = "continue"`
