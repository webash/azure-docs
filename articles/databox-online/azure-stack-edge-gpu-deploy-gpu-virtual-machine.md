# Deploy GPU VMs on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-GPU-and-pro-r-skus](../../includes/azure-stack-edge-applies-to-gpu-pro-r-sku.md)]

This article provides an overview of GPU virtual machines (VMs) on your Azure Stack Edge Pro GPU device. The article also describes how to create a GPU VM by using the Azure Resource Manager templates. 


## About GPU VMs

Your Azure Stack Edge devices may be equipped with 1 or 2 of Nvidia's Tesla T4 GPU. To deploy GPU-accelerated VM workloads on these devices, use GPU optimized VM sizes. For example, the NC T4 v3-series should be used to deploy inference workloads featuring T4 GPUs. 

For more information, see [NC T4 v3-series VMs](../virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series.md).

## Supported OS and GPU drivers 

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs, Nvidia GPU drivers must be installed. 

The Nvidia GPU driver extension installs appropriate Nvidia CUDA or GRID drivers. You can install or manage the extension using the Azure Resource Manager templates.

### Supported OS for GPU extension for Windows

This extension supports the following operating systems (OSs). Other versions may work but have not been tested in-house on GPU VMs running on Azure Stack Edge devices.

| Distribution | Version |
|---|---|
| Windows Server 2019 | Core |
| Windows Server 2016 | Core |

### Supported OS for GPU extension for Linux

This extension supports the following OS distros, depending on the driver support for specific OS version. Other versions may work but have not been tested in-house on GPU VMs running on Azure Stack Edge devices.


| Distribution | Version |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu | 18.04 LTS |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux | 7.4 |


## GPU VMs and Kubernetes

Before you deploy GPU VMs on your device, review the following considerations if Kubernetes is configured on the device.

#### For 1-GPU device: 

- **Create a GPU VM followed by Kubernetes configuration on your device**: In this scenario, the GPU VM creation and Kubernetes configuration will both be successful. Kubernetes will not have access to the GPU in this case.

- **Configure Kubernetes on your device followed by creation of a GPU VM**: In this scenario, the Kubernetes will claim the GPU on your device and the VM creation will fail as there are no GPU resources available.

#### For 2-GPU device

- **Create a GPU VM followed by Kubernetes configuration on your device**: In this scenario, the GPU VM that you create will claim one GPU on your device and Kubernetes configuration will also be successful and claim the remaining one GPU.	

- **Create two GPU VMs followed by Kubernetes configuration on your device**: In this scenario, the two GPU VMs will claim the two GPUs on the device and the Kubernetes is configured successfully with no GPUs. 

- **Configure Kubernetes on your device followed by creation of a GPU VM**: In this scenario, the Kubernetes will claim both the GPUs on your device and the VM creation will fail as no GPU resources are available.

<!--Li indicated that this is fixed. If you have GPU VMs running on your device and Kubernetes is also configured, then anytime the VM is deallocated (when you stop or remove a VM using Stop-AzureRmVM or Remove-AzureRmVM), there is a risk that the Kubernetes cluster will claim all the GPUs available on the device. In such an instance, you will not be able to restart the GPU VMs deployed on your device or create GPU VMs. -->


## Create GPU VMs

Follow these steps when deploying GPU VMs on your device:

1. Identify if your device will also be running Kubernetes. If the device will run Kubernetes, then you'll need to create the GPU VM first and then configure Kubernetes. If Kubernetes is configured first, then it will claim all the available GPU resources and the GPU VM creation will fail.

1. [Download the VM templates and parameters files](https://aka.ms/ase-vm-templates) to your client machine. Unzip it into a directory youâ€™ll use as a working directory.

1. Before you can deploy VMs on your Azure Stack Edge device, you must configure your client to connect to the device via Azure Resource Manager over Azure PowerShell. For detailed instructions, see [Connect to Azure Resource Manager on your Azure Stack Edge device](azure-stack-edge-gpu-connect-resource-manager.md).

1. To create GPU VMs, follow all the steps in the [Deploy VM on your Azure Stack Edge using templates](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-virtual-machine-templates.md) or [Deploy VM on your Azure Stack Edge using Azure portal](azure-stack-edge-gpu-deploy-virtual-machine-portal.md) except for the following differences: 

            
    1. If you create a VM using the templates, when specifying GPU VM sizes, make sure to use the NCasT4-v3-series in the `CreateVM.parameters.json` as these are supported for GPU VMs. For more information, see [Supported VM sizes for GPU VMs](azure-stack-edge-gpu-virtual-machine-sizes.md#ncast4_v3-series-preview).

        ```json
            "vmSize": {
          "value": "Standard_NC4as_T4_v3"
        },
        ```
        If you use the Azure portal to create your VM, you can still select a VM size from NCasT4-v3-series.

    1. Once the GPU VM is successfully created, you can view this VM in the list of virtual machines in your Azure Stack Edge resource in the Azure portal.

1. Select the VM and drill down to the details. Copy the IP allocated to the VM.

1. If needed, you could switch the compute network back to whatever you need. 


After the VM is created, you can deploy GPU extension using the extension template.


> [!NOTE]
> When updating your device software version from 2012 to later, you will need to manually stop the GPU VMs.
