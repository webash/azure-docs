# Monitoring Azure Event Hubs data reference
See [Monitoring Azure Event Hubs](monitor-event-hubs.md) for details on collecting and analyzing monitoring data for Azure Event Hubs.

## Metrics
This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics collected for Azure Event Hubs. The resource provider for these metrics is **Microsoft.EventHub/clusters** or **Microsoft.EventHub/clusters**.

### Request metrics
Counts the number of data and management operations requests.

| Metric Name |  Exportable via diagnostic settings | Unit | Aggregation type |  Description | Dimensions | 
| ---------- | ---------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Incoming Requests| Yes | Count | Total | The number of requests made to the Event Hubs service over a specified period. | Entity name| 
| Successful Requests| No | Count | Total | The number of successful requests made to the Event Hubs service over a specified period. |  Entity name<br/><br/>Operation Result | 
| Throttled Requests| No | Count | Total |  The number of requests that were throttled because the usage was exceeded. | Entity name<br/><br/>Operation Result |

The following two types of errors are classified as **user errors**:

1. Client-side errors (In HTTP that would be 400 errors).
2. Errors that occur while processing messages.


### Message metrics
| Metric Name |  Exportable via diagnostic settings | Unit | Aggregation type |  Description | Dimensions | 
| ---------- | ---------- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | 
|Incoming Messages|  Yes | Count | Total | The number of events or messages sent to Event Hubs over a specified period. | Entity name|
|Outgoing Messages| Yes | Count | Total | The number of events or messages received from Event Hubs over a specified period. | Entity name | 
| Captured Messages| No | Count| Total | The number of captured messages.  |  Entity name | 
|Incoming Bytes | Yes |  Bytes | Total | Incoming bytes for an event hub over a specified period.  | Entity name| 
|Outgoing Bytes | Yes |  Bytes | Total |Outgoing bytes for an event hub over a specified period.  | Entity name | 
| Size | No |  Bytes | Average |  Size of an event hub in bytes.|Entity name |


> [!NOTE]
