# Analyze and migrate to Azure with Komprise

This article helps you integrate the Komprise Intelligent Data Manager infrastructure with Azure storage services. It includes considerations and implementation guidance on how to analyze, and migrate your data.

Komprise provides analytics and insights into network attached storage systems. It enables migration of data to Azure storage services like Azure Files, Azure NetApp Files, Azure Blob Storage, or ISV NAS solution. Learn more on [verified partner solutions for primary and secondary storage](../primary-secondary-storage/partner-overview.md).

Komprise will help in many different use cases, like:

- Analysis of on-premises unstructured data to gain insights for data management, movement, positioning, archiving, protection, and confinement.
- Migration of on-premises unstructured data to Azure Files, Azure NetApp Files, or ISV NAS solution,
- Copy, or archive, on-premises unstructured data to Azure Blob Storage with native access
- Migration of object storage solutions to Azure Blob Storage

Komprise is a software solution that is easily deployed in a virtual environment. The solutions consist of:
- **Director** - The administration console for the Komprise Grid. It is used to configure the environment, monitor activities, view reports and graphs, and set policies.
- **Observers** - Manage and analyze shares, summarize reports, communicate with the Director, and handle NFS data traffic.
- **Proxies** - Simplify and accelerate SMB/CIFS data flow, easily scale to meet performance requirements of a growing environment.

## Before you begin

Upfront planning will help in migrating the data with less risk.

### Get started with Azure

Microsoft offers a framework to follow to get you started with Azure. The [Cloud Adoption Framework](/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/) (CAF) is a detailed approach to enterprise digital transformation and comprehensive guide to planning a production grade cloud adoption. The CAF includes a step-by-step [Azure setup guide](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/) to help you get up and running quickly and securely. You can find an interactive version in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.quickstart=true#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Resources/QuickstartCenterBlade). You'll find sample architectures, specific best practices for deploying applications, and free training resources to put you on the path to Azure expertise.

### Considerations for migrations

Several aspects are important when considering migrations of file data to Azure. Before proceeding learn more:

- [Storage migration overview](../../../common/storage-migration-overview.md)
- latest supported features by Komprise Intelligent Data Management in [migration tools comparison matrix](./migration-tools-comparison.md).

Remember, you'll require enough network capacity to support migrations without impacting production applications. This section outlines the tools and techniques that are available to assess your network needs.

#### Determine unutilized internet bandwidth

It's important to know how much typically unutilized bandwidth (or *headroom*) you have available on a day-to-day basis. To help you assess whether you can meet your goals for:

- initial time for migrations when you're not using Azure Data Box for offline method
- time required to do incremental resync before final switch-over to the target file service

Use the following methods to identify the bandwidth headroom to Azure that is free to consume.

- If you're an existing Azure ExpressRoute customer, view your [circuit usage](../../../../expressroute/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts.md#circuits-metrics) in the Azure portal.
- Contact your ISP and request reports to show your existing daily and monthly utilization.
- There are several tools that can measure utilization by monitoring your network traffic at the router/switch level:
  - [SolarWinds Bandwidth Analyzer Pack](https://www.solarwinds.com/network-bandwidth-analyzer-pack?CMP=ORG-BLG-DNS)
  - [Paessler PRTG](https://www.paessler.com/bandwidth_monitoring)
  - [Cisco Network Assistant](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/network-assistant/index.html)
  - [WhatsUp Gold](https://www.whatsupgold.com/network-traffic-monitoring)

## Migration planning guide

Komprise is simple to set up and enables running multiple migrations simultaneously in three steps:

1.	Analyze your data to identify files to migrate or archive,
1.	Define policies to migrate, move, or copy unstructured data to Azure Storage,
1.	Activate policies that automatically move your data.

The first step is critical in finding and prioritizing the right data to migrate. Komprise analysis provides:

- Information on access time to identify:
  - Less frequently accessed files that you can cache on-premises or store on fast file service
  - Cold data you can archive to blob storage
- Information on top users, groups, or shares to determine the order of the migration and the most impacted group within the organization to assess business impact
- Number of files, or capacity per file type to determine type of stored files and if there are any possibilities to clean up the content. Cleaning up will reduce the migration effort, and reduce the cost of the target storage
- Number of files, or capacity per file size to determine the duration of migration. Large number of small files will take longer to migrate than small number of large files

## Deployment guide

Before deploying Komprise, the target service has to be deployed. You can learn more here:

- How to create [Azure File Share](../../../files/storage-how-to-create-file-share.md)
- How to create an [SMB volume](../../../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-volumes-smb.md) or [NFS export](../../../../azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-volumes.md) in Azure NetApp Files

The Komprise Grid is deployed in a virtual environment (Hyper-V, VMware, KVM) for speed, scalability, and resilience. Alternatively, you may setup the environment in your Azure subscription using [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/komprise_inc.intelligent_data_management).

1. Open the Azure portal, and search for  **storage accounts**. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/azure-locate-storage-account.png" alt-text="Shows where you've typed storage in the search box of the Azure portal.":::

    You can also click on the default  **Storage accounts**  icon.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/azure-portal.png" alt-text="Shows adding a storage account in the Azure portal.":::

2. Select  **Create**  to add an account:
   1. Select existing resource group or **Create new**
   2. Provide a unique name for your storage account
   3. Choose the region
   4. Select  **Standard**  or **Premium** performance, depending on your needs. If you select **Premium**, select **File shares** under **Premium account type**.
   5. Choose the **[Redundancy](../../../common/storage-redundancy.md)** that meets your data protection requirements
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/azure-account-create-1.png" alt-text="Shows storage account settings in the portal.":::

3. Next, we recommend the default settings from the **Advanced** screen. If you are migrating to Azure Files, we recommend enabling **Large file shares** if available.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/azure-account-create-2.png" alt-text="Shows Advanced settings tab in the portal.":::

4. Keep the default networking options for now and move on to  **Data protection**. You can choose to enable soft delete, which allows you to recover an accidentally deleted data within the defined retention period. Soft delete offers protection against accidental or malicious deletion.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/azure-account-create-3.png" alt-text="Shows the Data Protection settings in the portal.":::

5. Add tags for organization if you use tagging and **Create** your account.
 
6. Two quick steps are all that are now required before you can add the account to your Komprise environment. Navigate to the account you created in the Azure portal and select File shares under the File service menu. Add a File share and choose a meaningful name. Then, navigate to the Access keys item under Settings and copy the Storage account name and one of the two access keys. If the keys are not showing, click on the **Show keys**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/azure-access-key.png" alt-text="Shows access key settings in the portal.":::

7. Navigate to the **Properties** of the Azure File share. Write down the URL address, it will be required to add the Azure connection into the Komprise target file share:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/azure-files-endpoint.png" alt-text="Find Azure files endpoint.":::

8. (_Optional_) You can add extra layers of security to your deployment.
 
   1. Configure role-based access to limit who can make changes to your storage account. For more information, see [Built-in roles for management operations](../../../common/authorization-resource-provider.md#built-in-roles-for-management-operations).
 
   2.  Restrict access to the account to specific network segments with [storage firewall settings](../../../common/storage-network-security.md). Configure firewall settings to prevent access from outside of your corporate network.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/azure-storage-firewall.png" alt-text="Shows storage firewall settings in the portal.":::

   3.  Set a [delete lock](../../../../azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources.md) on the account to prevent accidental deletion of the storage account.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/azure-resource-lock.png" alt-text="Shows setting a delete lock in the portal.":::

   4.  Configure extra [security best practices](../../../blobs/security-recommendations.md).

1.	**Download** the Komprise Observer virtual appliance from the Director, deploy it to your hypervisor and configure it with the network and domain. Director is provided as a cloud service managed by Komprise. Information needed to access Director is sent with the welcome email once you purchase the solution.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/komprise-setup-1.png" alt-text="Download appropriate image for Komprise Observer from Director":::

1. To add the shares to analyze and migrate, you have two options:
   1. **Discover** all the shares in your storage environment by entering:
       - Platform for the source NAS
       - Hostname or IP address
       - Display name
       - Credentials (for SMB shares)

        :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/komprise-setup-2.png" alt-text="Specify NAS system to discover":::

    1. **Specify** a file share by entering:
       - Storage information
       - Protocol
       - Path
       - Display Name
       - Credentials (for SMB shares)
  
        :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/komprise-setup-3.png" alt-text="Specify NAS solutions to discover":::

    This step must be repeated to add other source and destination shares. To add Azure Files as a destination, you need to provide the Azure storage account and file share details:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/komprise-azure-files-1.png" alt-text="Select Azure Files as a target service":::

    :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/komprise-azure-files-2.png" alt-text="Enter details for Azure Files":::

## Migration guide

Komprise provides live migration, where end users and applications are not disrupted and can continue to access data during the migration. The migration process automates migrating directories, files, and links from a source to a destination. At each step data integrity is checked. All attributes, permissions, and access controls from the source are applied.

To configure and run a migration, follow these steps:

1. Log into your Komprise console. Information needed to access the console is sent with the welcome email once you purchase the solution.
1. Navigate to **Migrate** and click on **Add Migration**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/komprise-new-migrate.png" alt-text="Add new migration job":::

1. Add migration task by selecting proper source and destination share. Provide a migration name. Once configured, click on **Start Migration**. 
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/komprise-add-migration.png" alt-text="Specify details for the migration job":::

   (_Optional_) Define if you want to preserve access time and SMB ACLs on the destination. This option depends on the selected source and destination file service and protocol.

2. Once the migration started, you can go to **Migrate** to monitor the progress.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/komprise-monitor-migrations.png" alt-text="Monitor all migration jobs":::

3. Once all changes have been migrated, run one final migration by clicking on **Actions** and selecting **Start final iteration**. Before final migration, we recommend stopping access to source file shares or moving them to read-only mode (for users and applications). This step will make sure no changes happen on the source.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/komprise-quick-start-guide/komprise-final-migration.png" alt-text="Do one last migration before switching over":::

    Once the final migration finishes, transition all users and applications to the destination share. Switch over to the new file service usually requires changing the configuration of DNS servers, DFS servers, or changing the mount points to the new destination. 

4. As a last step, mark the migration completed.
