# Running ISV file services in Azure

Azure offers various options for storing file data. Azure native services are:
- [Azure Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/) – Fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry-standard SMB and NFS protocols. Azure files offer two different types (standard and premium) with different performance characteristics.
- [Azure NetApp Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/netapp/) – Fully managed file shares in the cloud designed to meet the performance requirements for enterprise line-of-business applications. Azure NetApp Files offer multiple service levels with different performance limitations (standard, premium, and ultra).
- [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/) – large-scale object storage platform for storing unstructured data. Azure Blob Storage offer two different types (standard and premium) with different performance characteristics. 
  
There are several articles that describe the differences and recommendation on selecting the native file service. You can learn more:
- Our migration guide describes the [basic flow chart](../../../common/storage-migration-overview.md#choose-a-target-storage-service)
- [Detailed comparison between Azure Files and Azure NetApp Files](../../../files/storage-files-netapp-comparison.md)

Many independent software vendor (ISV) solutions can provide file services in Azure. This article addresses two topics:
- provides general considerations on selecting file services
- outlines the differences between ISV solutions.
  
Full list of verified ISV solutions is available on [Azure Storage partners for primary and secondary storage](./partner-overview.md).

## Considerations

When selecting the best solution for running a file services in Azure, several considerations are important.

### Basic considerations

Basic functionality consideration examines the most common functionalities of the underlying storage platforms. This step is done initially to explore what solutions provide the basic functionality we need to satisfy our requirements. Important basic features vary from case to case. The most common ones are protocol support, namespace size, automatic tiering, encryption, WORM support, and authentication. You can see the list of basic functionalities that our ISV solutions support in [feature comparison](#isv-solutions-comparison).

### Performance considerations

After selecting which solution satisfies basic functionality, required performance must be considered. Estimating performance fit depends on three basic performance characteristics:
  - Latency
  - Bandwidth
  - IOPS or TPS

Importance of basic performance characteristics depends on the concurrency of the workloads (number of requests in parallel) and the block size (request size).

| Workload type | Recommendations |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| **Low concurrency** | Latency is the most critical consideration. Smaller the latency, more performance can be achieved. In workloads with low concurrency, IOPS and bandwidth limitations are rarely crossed |
| **High concurrency** | Latency impact is much smaller because of high concurrency. IOPS and / or bandwidth must be considered. |
| **Block size** | For workloads with small block sizes, IOPS limits are more important to consider while bandwidth limits are more important for workloads with large block sizes. |

Any storage workload can be described with those characteristics in mind. For example, OLTP workloads typically have high concurrency and small block sizes. HPC workloads usually have high concurrency, but block size can vary, from small to large. 
    
Some general rules are always recommended:
  - Protocol selection: if possible, use SMB3 with multichannel support or NFSv3 with nconnect support as that will provide better performance. Avoid using legacy protocols both from performance, but also security considerations. Also note that clients can be tuned as well and is recommended to maximize the performance.
  - Networking: if VM type supports it, use accelerated networking. It will reduce the latency and always have a positive effect on the performance. 
  - VM type: select the VM type that is most suitable for the workload. If the workload has small number of clients, running file services in smaller number of larger VMs is better suited. In contrast, large number of clients can benefit from running file services in larger number of smaller VMs.
  - For low concurrency and small block size workloads explore solutions that:
    - use managed disks (Premium or Ultra SSD disks) or
    - have a suitable caching algorithm.
  - For high concurrency and large block size workloads, explore solutions that use Azure Blob Storage as a backend
