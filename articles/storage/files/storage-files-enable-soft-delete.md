# Enable soft delete on Azure file shares
Azure Files offers soft delete for file shares so that you can more easily recover your data when it's mistakenly deleted by an application or other storage account user. To learn more about soft delete, see [How to prevent accidental deletion of Azure file shares](storage-files-prevent-file-share-deletion.md).

## Applies to
| File share type | SMB | NFS |
|-|:-:|:-:|
| Standard file shares (GPv2), LRS/ZRS | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |
| Standard file shares (GPv2), GRS/GZRS | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |
| Premium file shares (FileStorage), LRS/ZRS | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |

## Prerequisites
- If you intend to use Azure PowerShell, [install the latest version](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).
- If you intend to use the Azure CLI, [install the latest version](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Getting started
The following sections show how to enable and use soft delete for Azure file shares on an existing storage account:

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Navigate to your storage account and select **File shares** under **Data storage**.
1. Select **Enabled** next to **Soft delete**.
1. Select **Enabled** for **Soft delete for all file shares**.
1. Select **File share retention period in days** and enter a number of your choosing.
1. Select **Save** to confirm your data retention settings.

Highlighting the file shares soft delete section, enable toggle, set a retention period, and save. This will enable soft delete for all file shares in your storage account.":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)
To enable soft delete, you must update the settings for all Azure file shares, also known as the `FileService` properties. The following example enables soft delete for all file shares in a storage account. Remember to replace `<resource-group>` and `<storage-account>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

```PowerShell
$resourceGroupName = "<resource-group>"
$storageAccountName = "<storage-account>"

Update-AzStorageFileServiceProperty `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName `
    -EnableShareDeleteRetentionPolicy $true `
    -ShareRetentionDays 7
```

You can verify if soft delete is enabled and view its retention policy with the following command:

```PowerShell
Get-AzStorageFileServiceProperty `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
To enable soft delete, you must update a file client's service properties. The following example enables soft delete for all file shares in a storage account. Remember to replace `<resource-group>` and `<storage-account>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

```bash
resourceGroupName="<resource-group>"
storageAccountName="<storage-account>"

az storage account file-service-properties update \
    --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    --account-name $storageAccountName \
    --enable-delete-retention true \
    --delete-retention-days 7
```

You can verify if soft delete is enabled and view its retention policy with the following command:

```bash
az storage account file-service-properties show \
    -resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    -account-name $storageAccountName
```

## Restore soft deleted file share

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)
To restore a soft deleted file share:

1. Navigate to your storage account and select **File shares**.
1. On the file share blade, enable **Show deleted shares** to display any shares that have been soft deleted.

    This will display any shares currently in a **Deleted** state.

    :::image type="content" source="media/storage-how-to-recover-deleted-account/undelete-file-share.png" alt-text="If the status column, the column next to the name column, is set to Deleted, then your file share is in a soft deleted state. And will be permanently deleted after your specified retention period.":::

1. Select the share and select **undelete**, this will restore the share.

    You can confirm the share is restored since its status switches to **Active**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/storage-how-to-recover-deleted-account/restored-file-share.png" alt-text="If the status column, the column next to the name column, is set to Active, then your file share has been restored.":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)
To restore a soft deleted file share, you must first get the `-DeletedShareVersion` value of the share. To get that value, use the following command to list out all the deleted shares for your storage account.

```PowerShell
Get-AzRmStorageShare `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName `
    -IncludeDeleted
```

Once you've identified the share you'd like to restore, you can use it with the following command to restore it:

```PowerShell
Restore-AzRmStorageShare `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName `
    -DeletedShareVersion 01D5E2783BDCDA97 # replace with your deleted version number
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
To restore a soft deleted file share, you must first get the `--deleted-version` value of the share. To get that value, use the following command to list out all the deleted shares for your storage account.

```bash
az storage share-rm list \
    --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    --storage-account $storageAccountName \
    --include-deleted
```

Once you've identified the share you'd like to restore, you can use it with the following command to restore it:

```bash
az storage share-rm restore -n deletedshare --deleted-version 01D64EB9886F00C4 -g yourResourceGroup --storage-account yourStorageaccount
```

## Disable soft delete
If you wish to stop using soft delete, follow these instructions. To permanently delete a file share that has been soft deleted, you must undelete it, disable soft delete, and then delete it again. 

# [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Navigate to your storage account and select **File shares** under **Data storage**.
1. Select the link next to **Soft delete**.
1. Select **Disabled** for **Soft delete for all file shares**.
1. Select **Save** to confirm your data retention settings.

    :::image type="content" source="media/storage-how-to-recover-deleted-account/files-disable-soft-delete.png" alt-text="Disabling soft delete will allow you to immediately and permanently delete all file shares in your storage account at your leisure.":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)
You can use the following command to disable soft delete on your storage account.

```PowerShell
Update-AzStorageFileServiceProperty `
    -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
    -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName `
    -EnableShareDeleteRetentionPolicy $false
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
You can use the following command to disable soft delete on your storage account.

```bash
az storage account file-service-properties update \
    --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    --storage-account $storageAccountName \
    --enable-delete-retention false
```
