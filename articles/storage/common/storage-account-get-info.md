# Get storage account configuration information

This article shows how to get configuration information and properties for an Azure Storage account by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI.

## Get the resource ID for a storage account

Every Azure Resource Manager resource has an associated resource ID that uniquely identifies it. Certain operations require that you provide the resource ID. You can get the resource ID for a storage account by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI.

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

To display the Azure Resource Manager resource ID for a storage account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your storage account in the Azure portal.
1. On the **Overview** page, in the **Essentials** section, select the **JSON View** link.
1. The resource ID for the storage account is displayed at the top of the page.

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To return the Azure Resource Manager resource ID for a storage account with PowerShell, make sure you have installed the [Az.Storage](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Storage) module. Next, call the [Get-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageaccount) command to return the storage account and get its resource ID:

```azurepowershell
(Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <storage-account>).Id
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To return the Azure Resource Manager resource ID for a storage account with Azure CLI, call the [az storage account show](/cli/azure/storage/account#az_storage_account_show) command and query the resource ID:

```azurecli
az storage account show \
    --name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --query id \
    --output tsv
```

## Get the account type, location, or replication SKU for a storage account

The account type, location, and replication SKU are some of the properties available on a storage account. You can use the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI to view these values.

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

To view the account type, location, or replication SKU for a storage account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your storage account in the Azure portal.
1. Locate these properties on the **Overview** page, in the **Essentials** section

    :::image type="content" source="media/storage-account-get-info/account-configuration-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing account configuration in the portal":::

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

To view the account type, location, or replication SKU for a storage account with PowerShell, call the [Get-AzStorageAccount](/powershell/module/az.storage/get-azstorageaccount) command to return the storage account, then check the properties:

```azurepowershell
$account = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resource-group> -Name <storage-account>
$account.Location
$account.Sku
$account.Kind
```

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To view the account type, location, or replication SKU for a storage account with PowerShell, call the [az storage account show](/cli/azure/storage/account#az_storage_account_show) command and query the properties:

```azurecli
az storage account show \
    --name <storage-account> \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --query '[location,sku,kind]' \
    --output tsv
```
