# Azure Sentinel UEBA enrichments reference

This article describes the Azure Sentinel **BehaviorAnalytics** table found in **Logs** and mentioned on the [entity details pages](identify-threats-with-entity-behavior-analytics.md#how-to-use-entity-pages), and provides the details of the entity enrichments fields in that table, the contents of which you can use to focus and sharpen your security incident investigations.

The following three dynamic fields from the BehaviorAnalytics table are described in the [tables below](#entity-enrichments-dynamic-fields).

The [UsersInsights](#usersinsights-field) and  [DevicesInsights](#devicesinsights-field) fields contain entity information from Active Directory / Azure AD and Microsoft Threat Intelligence sources.

The [ActivityInsights](#activityinsights-field) field contains entity information based on the behavioral profiles built by Azure Sentinel's entity behavior analytics. 

<a name="baseline-explained"></a>User activities are analyzed against a baseline that is dynamically compiled each time it is used. Each activity has its defined lookback period from which the dynamic baseline is derived. The lookback period is specified in the [**Baseline**](#activityinsights-field) column in this table.

> [!NOTE] 
> The **Enrichment name** column in all the [entity enrichment field](#entity-enrichments-dynamic-fields) tables displays two rows of information. 
> 
> - The first, in **bold**, is the "friendly name" of the enrichment.
> - The second *(in italics and parentheses)* is the field name of the enrichment as stored in the [**Behavior Analytics table**](#behavioranalytics-table).

## BehaviorAnalytics table
