# Customize alert details in Azure Sentinel 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The alert details feature is in **PREVIEW**. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Introduction

When you define a name and description for your scheduled analytics rules, and you assign them severities and MITRE ATT&CK tactics, all alerts generated by a particular rule - and all incidents created as a result - will be displayed with the same name, description, and so on, without regard to the particular content of a specific instance of the alert.

With the **alert details** feature, you can tailor an alert's appearance to its content. Here you can select parameters in your alert that can be represented in the name or description of each instance of the alert, or that can contain the tactics and severity assigned to that instance of the alert. If the selected parameter has no value (or an invalid value in the case of tactics and severity), the alert details will revert to the defaults specified in the first page of the wizard.

The procedure detailed below is part of the analytics rule creation wizard. It's treated here independently to address the scenario of adding or changing alert details in an existing analytics rule.

## How to customize alert details

1. From the Azure Sentinel navigation menu, select **Analytics**.

1. Select a scheduled query rule and click **Edit**. Or create a new rule by clicking **Create > Scheduled query rule** at the top of the screen.

1. Click the **Set rule logic** tab.

1. In the **Alert enrichment (Preview)** section, expand **Alert details**.

1. In the now-expanded **Alert details** section, add free text that includes parameters corresponding to the details you want to display in the alert:

    1. In the **Alert Name Format** field, enter the text you want to appear as the name of the alert (the alert text), and include, in double curly brackets, any parameters you want to be part of the alert text.

        Example: `Alert from {{ProviderName}}: {{AccountName}} failed to log on to computer {{ComputerName}} with IP address {{IPAddress}}.`

    1. Do the same with the **Alert Description Format** field.
    
    1. Use the **Tactic Column** and **Severity Column** fields only if your query results contain columns with this information in them. For each one, choose the column that contains the corresponding information.

    If you change your mind, or if you made a mistake, you can remove an alert detail by clicking the trash can icon next to the **Tactic/Severity Column** fields or delete the free text from the **Alert Name/Description Format** fields.

1. When you have finished customizing your alert details, continue to the next tab in the wizard. If you're editing an existing rule, click the **Review and create** tab. Once the rule validation is successful, click **Save**.
