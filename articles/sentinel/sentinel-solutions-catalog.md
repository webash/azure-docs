# Azure Sentinel solutions catalog

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Azure Sentinel solutions experience is currently in **PREVIEW**, as are all individual solution packages. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

[Azure Sentinel solutions](sentinel-solutions.md) provide a consolidated way to acquire Azure Sentinel content - like data connectors, workbooks, analytics, and automations - in your workspace with a single deployment step.
