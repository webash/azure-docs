# Threat intelligence integration in Azure Sentinel

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Threat Intelligence data connectors in Azure Sentinel are currently in public preview.
> This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Azure Sentinel gives you a few different ways to [use threat intelligence feeds](import-threat-intelligence.md) to enhance your security analysts' ability to detect and prioritize known threats. 

You can use one of many available integrated threat intelligence platform (TIP) products, you can connect to TAXII servers to take advantage of any STIX-compatible threat intelligence source, and you can also make use of any custom solutions that can communicate directly with the [Microsoft Graph Security tiIndicators API](/graph/api/resources/tiindicator).

You can also connect to threat intelligence sources from playbooks, in order to enrich incidents with TI information that can help direct investigation and response actions.

## TAXII threat intelligence feeds

To connect to TAXII threat intelligence feeds, use the [Threat intelligence - TAXII](connect-threat-intelligence.md#connect-azure-sentinel-to-taxii-servers) data connector, together with the data supplied by each vendor linked below. You may need to contact the vendor directly to obtain the necessary data to use with the connector.
