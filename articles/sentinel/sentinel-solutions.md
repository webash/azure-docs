# About Azure Sentinel solutions

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Azure Sentinel solutions experience is currently in **PREVIEW**, as are all individual solution packages. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Azure Sentinel solutions provide in-product discoverability, single-step deployment, and enablement of end-to-end product, domain, and/or vertical scenarios in Azure Sentinel. This experience is powered by [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace) for solutions’ discoverability, deployment, and enablement, and by [Microsoft Partner Center](/partner-center/overview) for solutions’ authoring and publishing.

## Why Azure Sentinel solutions?

- Customers can easily discover packaged content and integrations that deliver value for a product, domain, or vertical within Azure Sentinel.

- Customers can easily deploy content in a single step, and optionally enable content to get started immediately.

- Providers or partners can deliver combined product or domain or vertical value using solutions in Azure Sentinel, and also be able to productize investments.

## Types of Azure Sentinel solutions

Azure Sentinel currently offers **packaged content** solutions. [These solutions](sentinel-solutions-catalog.md) include combinations of one or more data connectors, workbooks, analytics rules, playbooks, hunting queries, parsers, watchlists, and other components for Azure Sentinel. Learn how to [find and deploy packaged content solutions](sentinel-solutions-deploy.md).

There are two other types of solutions for Azure Sentinel that can be offered at this time in the generic Azure Marketplace, though they will not appear in the Azure Sentinel solutions gallery:

- **Integrations** – includes services or tools built using Azure Sentinel APIs or Azure Log Analytics APIs to enable customers to integrate their existing applications with Azure Sentinel or migrate data, queries, etc.from existing applications to Azure Sentinel.

- **Service offerings** – includes listings to specific managed services for Azure Sentinel.
