# Azure Sentinel SAP solution: security content reference (public preview)

This article details the security content available for the [Azure Sentinel SAP solution](sap-deploy-solution.md#deploy-sap-security-content).

Available security content includes a built-in workbook and built-in analytics rules. You can also add SAP-related [watchlists](watchlists.md) to use in your search, detection rules, threat hunting, and response playbooks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure Sentinel SAP solution is currently in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
