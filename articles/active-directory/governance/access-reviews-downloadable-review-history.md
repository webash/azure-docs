# Create and manage downloadable access review history report (Preview) in Azure AD access reviews

With Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Access Reviews, you can create a downloadable review history to help your organization gain more insight. The report pulls the decisions that were taken by reviewers when a report is created. These reports can be constructed to include specific access reviews, for a specific time frame, and can be filtered to include different review types and review results.
 
## Who can access and request review history

Review history and request review history are available for any user if they're authorized to view access reviews. To see which roles can view and create access reviews, see [What resource types can be reviewed?](deploy-access-reviews.md#what-resource-types-can-be-reviewed). Global Administrator and Global Reader can see all access reviews. All other users are only allowed to see reports on access reviews that they've generated.

## How to create a review history report
