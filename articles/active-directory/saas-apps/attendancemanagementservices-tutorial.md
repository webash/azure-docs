# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Attendance Management Services

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Attendance Management Services with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Attendance Management Services with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Attendance Management Services.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Attendance Management Services with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Attendance Management Services, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Attendance Management Services single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Attendance Management Services supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Attendance Management Services from the gallery

To configure the integration of Attendance Management Services into Azure AD, you need to add Attendance Management Services from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Attendance Management Services** in the search box.
1. Select **Attendance Management Services** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Attendance Management Services

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Attendance Management Services using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Attendance Management Services.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Attendance Management Services, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Attendance Management Services SSO](#configure-attendance-management-services-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Attendance Management Services test user](#create-attendance-management-services-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Attendance Management Services that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Attendance Management Services** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

## Next steps

Once you configure Attendance Management Services you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
