# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Zero Trust Remote Access Platform

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Zero Trust Remote Access Platform with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Zero Trust Remote Access Platform with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Zero Trust Remote Access Platform.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Zero Trust Remote Access Platform with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Zero Trust Remote Access Platform single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Zero Trust Remote Access Platform supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Zero Trust Remote Access Platform supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Zero Trust Remote Access Platform from the gallery

To configure the integration of Zero Trust Remote Access Platform into Azure AD, you need to add Zero Trust Remote Access Platform from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Zero Trust Remote Access Platform** in the search box.
1. Select **Zero Trust Remote Access Platform** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Zero Trust Remote Access Platform

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Zero Trust Remote Access Platform using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Zero Trust Remote Access Platform.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Zero Trust Remote Access Platform, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Zero Trust Remote Access Platform SSO](#configure-zero-trust-remote-access-platform-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Zero Trust Remote Access Platform test user](#create-zero-trust-remote-access-platform-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Zero Trust Remote Access Platform that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Zero Trust Remote Access Platform** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

### Create Zero Trust Remote Access Platform test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Zero Trust Remote Access Platform. Zero Trust Remote Access Platform supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Zero Trust Remote Access Platform, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Zero Trust Remote Access Platform Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Zero Trust Remote Access Platform Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Zero Trust Remote Access Platform for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Zero Trust Remote Access Platform tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Zero Trust Remote Access Platform for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).


## Next steps

Once you configure Banyan Command Center you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
