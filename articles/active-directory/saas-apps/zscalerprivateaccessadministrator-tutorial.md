# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Zscaler Private Access Administrator

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Zscaler Private Access Administrator with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Zscaler Private Access Administrator with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Zscaler Private Access Administrator.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Zscaler Private Access Administrator Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Zscaler Private Access Administrator Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Zscaler Private Access Administrator for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Zscaler Private Access Administrator tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Zscaler Private Access Administrator for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Zscaler Private Access Administrator you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
