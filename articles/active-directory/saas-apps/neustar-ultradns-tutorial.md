# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Neustar UltraDNS

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Neustar UltraDNS with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Neustar UltraDNS with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Neustar UltraDNS.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Neustar UltraDNS with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Neustar UltraDNS single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Neustar UltraDNS supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Neustar UltraDNS supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Adding Neustar UltraDNS from the gallery

To configure the integration of Neustar UltraDNS into Azure AD, you need to add Neustar UltraDNS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Neustar UltraDNS** in the search box.
1. Select **Neustar UltraDNS** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Neustar UltraDNS

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Neustar UltraDNS using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Neustar UltraDNS.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Neustar UltraDNS, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Neustar UltraDNS SSO](#configure-neustar-ultradns-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Neustar UltraDNS test user](#create-neustar-ultradns-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Neustar UltraDNS that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Neustar UltraDNS** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.sso.security.neustar`

    > [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-on URL. Contact [Neustar UltraDNS Client support team](mailto:IDMTeam@neustar.biz) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Neustar UltraDNS application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Neustar UltraDNS application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------- | --------- |
	| givenname | first name |
	| mail | email address |
	| sn | last name |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Neustar UltraDNS** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Neustar UltraDNS.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Neustar UltraDNS**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Neustar UltraDNS SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Neustar UltraDNS** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Neustar UltraDNS support team](mailto:IDMTeam@neustar.biz). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Neustar UltraDNS test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Neustar UltraDNS. Neustar UltraDNS supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Neustar UltraDNS, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

SP initiated:

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal. This will redirect to Neustar UltraDNS Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

* Go to Neustar UltraDNS Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

IDP initiated:

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Neustar UltraDNS for which you set up the SSO

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Neustar UltraDNS tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Neustar UltraDNS for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Neustar UltraDNS you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
