# Tutorial: Configure Insite LMS for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to do in both Insite LMS and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [Insite LMS](https://www.insite-it.net/) using the Azure AD Provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities Supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Insite LMS
> * Remove users in Insite LMS when they do not require access anymore
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and Insite LMS

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](../develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) 
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](../roles/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning (for example, Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator). 
* A [Insite LMS tenant](https://www.insite-it.net/).
* A user account in Insite LMS with Admin permissions.

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment

1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and Insite LMS](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2. Configure Insite LMS to support provisioning with Azure AD

1. Navigate to `https://portal.insitelms.net/<OrganizationName>`.
1. Download and install the Desktop Client.
1. Log in with your Admin Account and Navigate to **Users** Module.
1. Select the User `scim@insitelms.net` and press the button **Generate Access Token**. If you can't find the scim-User, contact the Support-Team
	1.	Choose **AzureAdScimProvisioning** and press **generate** 
	1.	Copy the **AccessToken**
1. The **Tenant Url** is `https://web.insitelms.net/<OrganizationName>/api/scim`.

## Step 3. Add Insite LMS from the Azure AD application gallery

Add Insite LMS from the Azure AD application gallery to start managing provisioning to Insite LMS. If you have previously setup Insite LMS for SSO, you can use the same application. However it's recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4. Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user / group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* When assigning users and groups to Insite LMS, you must select a role other than **Default Access**. Users with the Default Access role are excluded from provisioning and will be marked as not effectively entitled in the provisioning logs. If the only role available on the application is the default access role, you can [update the application manifest](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to add more roles. 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 


## Step 5. Configure automatic user provisioning to Insite LMS 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Insite LMS app based on user and group assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Insite LMS in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Insite LMS**.

	![The Insite LMS link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)

1.  Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Provisioning tab automatic](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. In the **Admin Credentials** section, enter your Insite LMS **Tenant URL** and **Secret token** information. Select **Test Connection** to ensure that Azure AD can connect to Insite LMS. If the connection fails, ensure that your Insite LMS account has admin permissions and try again.

 	![Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications. Select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. In the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Insite LMS**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Insite LMS in the **Attribute Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Insite LMS for update operations. If you change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you'll need to ensure that the Insite LMS API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select **Save** to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|
   |---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String|&check;|
   |active|Boolean|
   |name.givenName|String|
   |name.familyName|String|
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "work"].value|String|

1. To configure scoping filters, see the instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Insite LMS, change **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users or groups that you want to provision to Insite LMS by selecting the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, select **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to do than next cycles, which occur about every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running.

## Step 6. Monitor your deployment

After you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users were provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully.
* Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it's to completion.
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. To learn more about quarantine states, see [Application provisioning status of quarantine](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).
