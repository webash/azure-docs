# Tutorial: Integrate Sansan with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Sansan with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Sansan with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Sansan.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Sansan with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Sansan single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.
* Sansan supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Sansan from the gallery

To configure the integration of Sansan into Azure AD, you need to add Sansan from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Sansan** in the search box.
1. Select **Sansan** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Sansan

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Sansan using a test user called **Britta Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Sansan.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Sansan, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
   1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
   1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Sansan](#configure-sansan)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
   1. **[Create Sansan test user](#create-sansan-test-user)** to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Sansan that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Sansan** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   `https://ap.sansan.com/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Check the actual Identifier and Reply URL values on the **Sansan admin settings**.

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Sansan. For more information on how to create a user, please refer [these](https://jp-help.sansan.com/hc/articles/206508997-Adding-users) steps.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Sansan Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Sansan Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Sansan tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Sansan Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Sansan you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
