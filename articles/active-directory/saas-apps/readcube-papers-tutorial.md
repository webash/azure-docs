# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with ReadCube Papers

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ReadCube Papers with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate ReadCube Papers with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to ReadCube Papers.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ReadCube Papers with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ReadCube Papers single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* ReadCube Papers supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* ReadCube Papers supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

    1. **[Create ReadCube Papers test user](#create-readcube-papers-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ReadCube Papers that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure ReadCube Papers SSO

To configure single sign-on on **ReadCube Papers** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [ReadCube Papers support team](mailto:support@readcube.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create ReadCube Papers test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in ReadCube Papers. ReadCube Papers supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in ReadCube Papers, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to ReadCube Papers Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to ReadCube Papers Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the ReadCube Papers tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to ReadCube Papers Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure ReadCube Papers you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
