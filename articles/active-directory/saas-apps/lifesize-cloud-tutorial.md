# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Lifesize Cloud

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Lifesize Cloud with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Lifesize Cloud with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Lifesize Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Lifesize Cloud with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Lifesize Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Azure AD US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Azure AD US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Lifesize Cloud supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Lifesize Cloud supports **Automated** user provisioning.

## Add Lifesize Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Lifesize Cloud into Azure AD, you need to add Lifesize Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Lifesize Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **Lifesize Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Lifesize Cloud

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Lifesize Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Lifesize Cloud.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Lifesize Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Lifesize Cloud SSO](#configure-lifesize-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Lifesize Cloud test user](#create-lifesize-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Lifesize Cloud that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Lifesize Cloud** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://login.lifesizecloud.com/ls/?acs`

    b. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://login.lifesizecloud.com/<COMPANY_NAME>`

    c. Click **set additional URLs**.

    d. In the **Relay State** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://webapp.lifesizecloud.com/?ent=<IDENTIFIER>`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-on URL, Identifier and Relay State. Contact [Lifesize Cloud Client support team](https://legacy.lifesize.com/en/support) to get Sign-On URL, and Identifier values and you can get Relay State value from SSO Configuration that is explained later in the tutorial. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create Lifesize Cloud test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Lifesize Cloud. Lifesize cloud does support automatic user provisioning. After successful authentication at Azure AD, the user will be automatically provisioned in the application.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Lifesize Cloud Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Lifesize Cloud Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Lifesize Cloud tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Lifesize Cloud Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Lifesize Cloud you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
