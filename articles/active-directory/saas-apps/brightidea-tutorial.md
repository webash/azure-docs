# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Brightidea

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Brightidea with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Brightidea with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Brightidea.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Brightidea with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Brightidea single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Brightidea supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Brightidea supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Brightidea from the gallery

To configure the integration of Brightidea into Azure AD, you need to add Brightidea from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Brightidea** in the search box.
1. Select **Brightidea** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Brightidea

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Brightidea using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Brightidea.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Brightidea, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Brightidea SSO](#configure-brightidea-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Brightidea test user](#create-brightidea-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Brightidea that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Brightidea** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you have **Service Provider metadata file** and wish to configure in **IDP** initiated mode perform the following steps:

    a. Click **Upload metadata file**.

    ![Upload metadata file](common/upload-metadata.png)

    b. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

    ![choose metadata file](common/browse-upload-metadata.png)

    c. After the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in Brightidea section textbox:

    > [!Note]
    > If the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values do not get auto populated, then fill in the values manually according to your requirement.

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.brightidea.com`

4. On the **Set-up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

   * In the **Screen Name** textbox, enter the value as `givenName`.

   * Click **Save Changes**. 

### Create Brightidea test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Brightidea. Brightidea supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Brightidea, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Brightidea Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Brightidea Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Brightidea for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Brightidea tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Brightidea for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Brightidea you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
