# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Sectigo Certificate Manager

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Sectigo Certificate Manager with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Sectigo Certificate Manager with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Sectigo Certificate Manager.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Sectigo Certificate Manager with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Sectigo Certificate Manager, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* Sectigo Certificate Manager account.

> [!NOTE]
> Sectigo runs multiple instances of Sectigo Certificate Manager. The main instance of Sectigo Certificate Manager is  **https:\//cert-manager.com**, and this URL is used in this tutorial.  If your account is on a different instance, you must adjust the URLs accordingly.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment and integrate Sectigo Certificate Manager with Azure AD.

Sectigo Certificate Manager supports the following features:

* **SP-initiated single sign-on**.
* **IDP-initiated single sign-on**.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Sectigo Certificate Manager in the Azure portal

To configure the integration of Sectigo Certificate Manager into Azure AD, you need to add Sectigo Certificate Manager from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Sectigo Certificate Manager** in the search box.
1. Select **Sectigo Certificate Manager** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Sectigo Certificate Manager

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Sectigo Certificate Manager using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Sectigo Certificate Manager.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Sectigo Certificate Manager, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Sectigo Certificate Manager SSO](#configure-sectigo-certificate-manager-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Sectigo Certificate Manager test user](#create-sectigo-certificate-manager-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Sectigo Certificate Manager that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Sectigo Certificate Manager** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    1. In the **Reply URL** box, for the main Sectigo Certificate Manager instance, enter **https:\//cert-manager.com/Shibboleth.sso/SAML2/POST**.
        
    > [!NOTE]
    > Although in general, the **Sign-on URL** is mandatory for **SP-initiated mode**, it isn't needed to log in from Sectigo Certificate Manager.        

1. Optionally, in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, to configure **IDP-initiated mode** and to allow **Test** to work, perform the following steps:

	1. Select **Set additional URLs**.

	1. In the **Relay State** box, enter your Sectigo Certificate Manager customer-specific URL. For the main Sectigo Certificate Manager instance, enter **https:\//cert-manager.com/customer/\<customerURI\>/idp**.

1. In the **User Attributes & Claims** section, perform the following steps:

	1. Delete all **Additional claims**.
	
	1. Select **Add new claim** and add the following four claims:
	
        | Name | Namespace | Source | Source attribute | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | eduPersonPrincipalName | empty | Attribute | user.userprincipalname | Must match the **IdP Person ID** field in Sectigo Certificate Manager for Admins. |
        | mail | empty | Attribute | user.mail | Required |
        | givenName | empty | Attribute | user.givenname | Optional |

## Configure Sectigo Certificate Manager SSO

To configure single sign-on on the Sectigo Certificate Manager side, send the downloaded Federation Metadata XML file to the [Sectigo Certificate Manager support team](https://sectigo.com/support). The Sectigo Certificate Manager support team uses the information you send them to ensure that the SAML single sign-on connection is set properly on both sides.

### Create Sectigo Certificate Manager test user

In this section, you create a user named Britta Simon in Sectigo Certificate Manager. Work withÂ the [Sectigo Certificate Manager support team](https://sectigo.com/support) to add the user in the Sectigo Certificate Manager platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration.

#### Test from Sectigo Certificate Manager (SP-initiated single sign-on)

Browse to your customer-specific URL (for the main Sectigo Certificate Manager instance, https:\//cert-manager.com/customer/\<customerURI\>/, and select the button below **Or Sign In With**.  If configured correctly, you will be automatically signed in to Sectigo Certificate Manager.
