# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Deputy

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Deputy with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Deputy with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Deputy.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Deputy with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Deputy single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Deputy supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* Deputy supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Deputy from the gallery

To configure the integration of Deputy into Azure AD, you need to add Deputy from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Deputy** in the search box.
1. Select **Deputy** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Deputy

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Deputy using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Deputy.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Deputy, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Deputy SSO](#configure-deputy-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Deputy test user](#create-deputy-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Deputy that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Deputy** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    ```http
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.au.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-au.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.na.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-na.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.eu.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-eu.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.as.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-as.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.la.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-la.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.af.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-af.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.an.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-an.deputy.com
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.deputy.com
    ```

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:
	
    ```http
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.au.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-au.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.na.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-na.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.eu.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-eu.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.as.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs.
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-as.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.la.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-la.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.af.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-af.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.an.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.ent-an.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    https://<subdomain>.<region>.deputy.com/exec/devapp/samlacs
    ```

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<your-subdomain>.<region>.deputy.com`

	>[!NOTE]
    > Deputy region suffix is optional, or it should use one of these: 
    > au | na | eu |as |la |af |an |ent-au |ent-na |ent-eu |ent-as | ent-la | ent-af | ent-an

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Deputy Client support team](https://www.deputy.com/call-centers-customer-support-scheduling-software) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Deputy application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Deputy application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| -------------- | --------- |
	| First name | user.givenname|
	| Last name | user.surname |

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to TeamzSkill Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to TeamzSkill Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the TeamzSkill for which you set up the SSO 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the TeamzSkill tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the TeamzSkill for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).


## Next steps

Once you configure Deputy you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
