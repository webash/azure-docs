# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Heroku

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Heroku with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Heroku with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Heroku.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Heroku with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Heroku single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Heroku supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Heroku supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Heroku from the gallery

To configure the integration of Heroku into Azure AD, you need to add Heroku from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Heroku** in the search box.
1. Select **Heroku** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Heroku

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Heroku using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Heroku.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Heroku, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Heroku SSO](#configure-heroku-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Heroku test user](#create-heroku-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Heroku that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Heroku** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://sso.heroku.com/saml/<company-name>/init`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://sso.heroku.com/saml/<company-name>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL and Identifier. You get these values from Heroku team, which is described in later sections of this article.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

6. On the **Set up Heroku** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Heroku.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Heroku**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Heroku SSO

1. In a different web browser window, sign-on to your Heroku tenant as an administrator.

2. Click the **Settings** tab.

3. On the **Single Sign On Page**, click **Upload Metadata**.

4. Upload the metadata file, which you have downloaded from the Azure portal.

5. When the setup is successful, administrators see a confirmation dialog and the URL of the SSO Login for end users is displayed.

6. Copy the **Heroku Login URL** and **Heroku Entity ID** values and go back to **Basic SAML Configuration** section in Azure portal and paste these values into the **Sign-On Url** and **Identifier (Entity ID)** textboxes respectively.

7. Click **Next**.

### Create Heroku test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Heroku. Heroku supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Heroku, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Heroku Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Heroku Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Heroku tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Heroku Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Heroku you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
