# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Verkada Command

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Verkada Command with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Verkada Command with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Verkada Command.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Verkada Command with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Verkada Command single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Verkada Command supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Verkada Command from the gallery

To configure the integration of Verkada Command into Azure AD, you need to add Verkada Command from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Verkada Command** in the search box.
1. Select **Verkada Command** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Verkada Command

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Verkada Command using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Verkada Command.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Verkada Command, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Verkada Command SSO](#configure-verkada-command-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Verkada Command test user](#create-verkada-command-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Verkada Command that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Verkada Command** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you have **Service Provider metadata file** and wish to configure in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

	a. Click **Upload metadata file**.

    ![Upload metadata file](common/upload-metadata.png)

	b. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

	![choose metadata file](common/browse-upload-metadata.png)

	c. After the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in Basic SAML Configuration section.

	> [!Note]
	> If the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values do not get auto populated, then fill in the values manually according to your requirement.

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://vauth.command.verkada.com/saml/login/<CLIENT_ID>`

	> [!NOTE]
    > The Sign-on URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Sign-on URL. Contact [Verkada Command Client support team](mailto:support@verkada.com) to get this value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Verkada Command application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. Verkada Command application expects **nameidentifier** to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

	![Screenshot shows Set additional U R Ls where you can enter a Sign on U R L.](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Verkada Command application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ------------ | --------- |
	| uniqueUserId | user.mail |
	| lastName | user.surname |
	| email | user.mail |
	| firstName | user.givenname |


1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Verkada Command** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Verkada Command.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Verkada Command**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Verkada Command SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Verkada Command** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Verkada Command support team](mailto:support@verkada.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Verkada Command test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Verkada Command. Work with [Verkada Command support team](mailto:support@verkada.com) to add the users in the Verkada Command platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Verkada Command Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Verkada Command Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Verkada Command for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Verkada Command tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Verkada Command for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Verkada Command you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
