# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with 15Five

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate 15Five with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate 15Five with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to 15Five.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to 15Five with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* 15Five single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* 15Five supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add 15Five from the gallery

To configure the integration of 15Five into Azure AD, you need to add 15Five from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **15Five** in the search box.
1. Select **15Five** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for 15Five

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with 15Five using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in 15Five.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with 15Five, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure 15Five SSO](#configure-15five-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create 15Five test user](#create-15five-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in 15Five that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **15Five** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<COMPANY_NAME>.15five.com`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<COMPANY_NAME>.15five.com/saml2/metadata/`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [15Five Client support team](https://www.15five.com/contact/) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

6. On the **Set up 15Five** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to 15Five.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **15Five**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure 15Five SSO

To configure single sign-on on **15Five** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [15Five support team](https://www.15five.com/contact/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create 15Five test user

To enable Azure AD users to log in to 15Five, they must be provisioned into 15Five. When 15Five, provisioning is a manual task.

### To configure user provisioning, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to your **15Five** company site as administrator.

2. Go to **Manage Company**.

    ![Manage Company](./media/15five-tutorial/profile.png "Manage Company")

3. Go to **People \> Add PEOPLE**.

    ![People](./media/15five-tutorial/account.png "People")

4. In the **Add New Person** section, perform the following steps:

    ![Add New Person](./media/15five-tutorial/add-person.png "Add New Person")

    a. Type the **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Title**, **Email address** of a valid Azure Active Directory account you want to provision into the related textboxes.

    b. Click **Done**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Azure AD account holder receives an email including a link to confirm the account before it becomes active.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to 15Five Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to 15Five Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the 15Five tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to 15Five Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure 15Five you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
