# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Check Point Infinity Portal

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Check Point Infinity Portal with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Check Point Infinity Portal with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Check Point Infinity Portal.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Check Point Infinity Portal with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Check Point Infinity Portal single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Check Point Infinity Portal supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Check Point Infinity Portal supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Check Point Infinity Portal from the gallery

To configure the integration of Check Point Infinity Portal into Azure AD, you need to add Check Point Infinity Portal from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Check Point Infinity Portal** in the search box.
1. Select **Check Point Infinity Portal** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Check Point Infinity Portal

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Check Point Infinity Portal using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Check Point Infinity Portal.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Check Point Infinity Portal, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Check Point Infinity Portal SSO](#configure-check-point-infinity-portal-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Check Point Infinity Portal test user](#create-check-point-infinity-portal-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Check Point Infinity Portal that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Check Point Infinity Portal** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    a. Copy the DNS record values and add them to the DNS values in your company domain name registrar.

    b. In the **SSO Authorization** section, click **Validate**.

    c. Wait for Check Point to approve your DNS record. The registrar update of the DNS records can last for up to 30 minutes.

### Create Check Point Infinity Portal test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Check Point Infinity Portal. Check Point Infinity Portal supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Check Point Infinity Portal, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Check Point Infinity Portal Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Check Point Infinity Portal Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Check Point Infinity Portal tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Check Point Infinity Portal Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).


## Next steps

Once you configure Check Point Infinity Portal you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
