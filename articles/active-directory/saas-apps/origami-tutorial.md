# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Origami

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Origami with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Origami with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Origami.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Origami with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Origami single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Origami supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Origami from the gallery

To configure the integration of Origami into Azure AD, you need to add Origami from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Origami** in the search box.
1. Select **Origami** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Origami

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Origami using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Origami.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Origami, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Origami SSO](#configure-origami-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Origami test user](#create-origami-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Origami that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Origami** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://live.origamirisk.com/origami/account/login?account=<COMPANY_NAME>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Origami Client support team](https://wordpress.org/support/theme/origami) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Origami.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Origami Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Origami Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Origami tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Origami Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Origami you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
