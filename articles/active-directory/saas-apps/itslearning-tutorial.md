# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with itslearning

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate itslearning with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate itslearning with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to itslearning.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to itslearning with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with itslearning, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* itslearning single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* itslearning supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding itslearning from the gallery

To configure the integration of itslearning into Azure AD, you need to add itslearning from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **itslearning** in the search box.
1. Select **itslearning** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for itslearning

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with itslearning using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in itslearning.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with itslearning, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure itslearning SSO](#configure-itslearning-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create itslearning test user](#create-itslearning-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in itslearning that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **itslearning** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	
    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type the URL:
    `urn:mace:saml2v2.no:services:com.itslearning`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type one of the following URLs:
	
    | Reply URL |
    |-------------|
    | `https://www.itsltest.com/elogin/AssertionConsumerService.aspx` |
    | `https://www.itslearning.com/elogin/AssertionConsumerService.aspx` |
    | 
    
    c. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type one of the following URLs:
	
    | Sign on URL |
    |-------------|
    | `https://www.itslearning.com/index.aspx` |
    | `https://us1.itslearning.com/index.aspx` |
    |

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

6. On the **Set up itslearning** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to itslearning.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **itslearning**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure itslearning SSO

To configure single sign-on on **itslearning** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [itslearning support team](mailto:support@itslearning.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create itslearning test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in itslearning. Work with [itslearning support team](mailto:support@itslearning.com) to add the users in the itslearning platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to itslearning Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to itslearning Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the itslearning tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to itslearning Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure itslearning you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
