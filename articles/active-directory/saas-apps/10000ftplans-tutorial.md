# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with 10,000ft Plans

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate 10,000ft Plans with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate 10,000ft Plans with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to 10,000ft Plans.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to 10,000ft Plans with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* 10,000ft Plans single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* 10,000ft Plans support **SP** initiated SSO.
* 10,000ft Plans support **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for 10,000ft Plans

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with 10,000ft Plans using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in 10,000ft Plans.

    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure 10,000ft Plans SSO](#configure-10000ft-plans-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create 10,000ft Plans test user](#create-10000ft-plans-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in 10,000ft Plans that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
