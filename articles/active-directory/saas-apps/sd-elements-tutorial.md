# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with SD Elements

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SD Elements with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate SD Elements with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to SD Elements.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SD Elements with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SD Elements single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* SD Elements supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add SD Elements from the gallery

To configure the integration of SD Elements into Azure AD, you need to add SD Elements from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SD Elements** in the search box.
1. Select **SD Elements** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for SD Elements

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with SD Elements using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SD Elements.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with SD Elements, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SD Elements SSO](#configure-sd-elements-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create SD Elements test user](#create-sd-elements-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SD Elements that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **SD Elements** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<TENANT_NAME>.sdelements.com/sso/saml2/metadata`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<TENANT_NAME>.sdelements.com/sso/saml2/acs/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [SD Elements Client support team](mailto:support@sdelements.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. SD Elements application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, SD Elements application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
    | --- | --- |
	| email |user.mail |
	| firstname |user.givenname |
	| lastname |user.surname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up SD Elements** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the SD Elements for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the SD Elements tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the SD Elements for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure SD Elements you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
