# Tutorial: Integrate Syncplicity with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Syncplicity with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Syncplicity with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Syncplicity.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Syncplicity with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Syncplicity single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment. 
* Syncplicity supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Syncplicity from the gallery

To configure the integration of Syncplicity into Azure AD, you need to add Syncplicity from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Under **Create**, click **Enterprise Application**.
1. In the **Browse Azure AD gallery** section, type **Syncplicity** in the search box.
1. Select **Syncplicity** from results panel and then click **Create** to add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Syncplicity

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Syncplicity using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Syncplicity.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Syncplicity, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Syncplicity SSO](#configure-syncplicity-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Syncplicity test user](#create-syncplicity-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Syncplicity that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
1. **[Update SSO](#update-sso)** - to make the necessary changes in Syncplicity if you have changed the SSO settings in Azure AD.

### Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Syncplicity** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<COMPANY_NAME>.syncplicity.com/sp`

    b. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<COMPANY_NAME>.syncplicity.com`
    
    c. In the **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<COMPANY_NAME>.syncplicity.com/Auth/AssertionConsumerService.aspx`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL,Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [Syncplicity Client support team](https://www.syncplicity.com/contact-us) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Edit**. Then in the dialog click the ellipsis button next to your active certificate and select **PEM certificate download**.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Syncplicity Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Syncplicity Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Syncplicity tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Syncplicity Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

### Update SSO

Whenever you need to make changes to the SSO, you need to check the **SAML Signing Certificate** being used. If the certificate has changed, make sure to upload the new one to Syncplicity as described in **[Configure Syncplicity SSO](#configure-syncplicity-sso)**.

If you are using the Syncplicity Mobile app, please contact the Syncplicity Customer Support (support@syncplicity.com) for assistance.

## Next steps

Once you configure Syncplicity you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
