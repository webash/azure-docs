# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Leadfamly

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Leadfamly with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Leadfamly with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Leadfamly.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Leadfamly with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Leadfamly single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Leadfamly supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Leadfamly from the gallery

To configure the integration of Leadfamly into Azure AD, you need to add Leadfamly from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Leadfamly** in the search box.
1. Select **Leadfamly** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Leadfamly

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Leadfamly using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Leadfamly.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Leadfamly, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Leadfamly SSO](#configure-leadfamly-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Leadfamly test user](#create-leadfamly-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Leadfamly that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Leadfamly** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://appv2.leadfamly.com/saml-sso/<INSTANCE ID>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL. Contact [Leadfamly Client support team](mailto:support@leadfamly.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Leadfamly Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Leadfamly Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Leadfamly tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Leadfamly Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Leadfamly you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
