# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Bonusly

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Bonusly with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Bonusly with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Bonusly.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Bonusly with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Bonusly, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Bonusly single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Bonusly supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Bonusly from the gallery

To configure the integration of Bonusly into Azure AD, you need to add Bonusly from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Bonusly** in the search box.
1. Select **Bonusly** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Bonusly

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Bonusly using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Bonusly.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Bonusly, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Bonusly SSO](#configure-bonusly-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Bonusly test user](#create-bonusly-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Bonusly that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Bonusly** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Bonusly for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Bonusly tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Bonusly for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Bonusly you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
