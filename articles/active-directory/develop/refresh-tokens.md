# Microsoft identity platform refresh tokens

When a client acquires an access token to access a protected resource, the client also receives a refresh token. The refresh token is used to obtain new access/refresh token pairs when the current access token expires. Refresh tokens are also used to acquire extra access tokens for other resources. Refresh tokens are bound to a combination of user and client, but aren't tied to a resource or tenant. This allows a client to use a refresh token to acquire access tokens across any combination of resource and tenant where it has permission to do so. Refresh tokens are encrypted and only the Microsoft identity platform can read them.

## Prerequisites

Before reading through this article, it's recommended that you go through the following articles:

* [ID tokens](id-tokens.md) in the Microsoft identity platform.
* [Access tokens](access-tokens.md) in the Microsoft identity platform.

## Refresh token lifetime

Refresh tokens have a significantly longer lifetime than access tokens. The default lifetime for the tokens is 90 days and they replace themselves with a fresh token upon every use. This means that whenever a refresh token is used to acquire a new access token, a new refresh token is also issued. The Microsoft identity platform doesn't revoke old refresh tokens when used to fetch new access tokens. Securely delete the old refresh token after acquiring a new one. Refresh tokens need to be stored safely like access tokens or application credentials. 

## Refresh token expiration

Refresh tokens can be revoked at any time, because of timeouts and revocations. Your app must handle rejections by the sign-in service gracefully when this occurs. This is done by sending the user to an interactive sign-in prompt to sign in again. 

### Token timeouts

Using [token lifetime configuration](active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes.md#refresh-and-session-token-lifetime-policy-properties), the lifetime of refresh tokens can be reduced or lengthened. This setting changes the length of time that a refresh token can go without use. For example, consider a scenario where a user doesn't open an app for more than 90 days. When the app attempts to use that 90+ day old refresh token, it will find that it has expired. Additionally, an admin can  require that second factors be used on a regular cadence, forcing the user to manually sign in at specific intervals. These scenarios include:

* Inactivity: refresh tokens are only valid for a period dictated by the `MaxInactiveTime`.  If the token isn't used (and replaced by the new token) within that time period, it will no longer be usable.
* Session age-out: If `MaxAgeSessionMultiFactor` or `MaxAgeSessionSingleFactor` have been set to something other than their default (Until-revoked), then reauthentication will be required after the time set in the MaxAgeSession* elapses.  This is used to force users to reauthenticate with a first or second factor periodically. 
* Examples:
  * The tenant has a MaxInactiveTime of five days, and the user went on vacation for a week. As such, Azure AD hasn't seen a new token request from the user in seven days. The next time the user requests a new token, they'll find their Refresh Token has been revoked, and they must enter their credentials again.
  * A sensitive application has a `MaxAgeSessionMultiFactor` of one day. A user will be required to go through MFA once more through an interactive prompt if they sign in again after a period of one day. For example, if a user logs in on Monday, and on Tuesday after 25 hours have elapsed. 

Not all refresh tokens follow the rules set in the token lifetime policy. Specifically, refresh tokens used in [single page apps](reference-third-party-cookies-spas.md) are always limited to 24 hours of activity, as if they have a `MaxAgeSessionSingleFactor` policy of 24 hours applied to them. 

### Revocation

Refresh tokens can be revoked by the server because of a change in credentials, user action, or admin action.  Refresh tokens fall into two classes: tokens issued to confidential clients (the rightmost column) and tokens issued to public clients (all other columns).

| Change | Password-based cookie | Password-based token | Non-password-based cookie | Non-password-based token | Confidential client token |
|---|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Password expires | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| Password changed by user | Revoked | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| User does SSPR | Revoked | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| Admin resets password | Revoked | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive | Stays alive |
| User revokes their refresh tokens [via PowerShell](/powershell/module/azuread/revoke-azureadsignedinuserallrefreshtoken) | Revoked | Revoked | Revoked | Revoked | Revoked |
| Admin revokes all refresh tokens for a user [via PowerShell](/powershell/module/azuread/revoke-azureaduserallrefreshtoken) | Revoked | Revoked |Revoked | Revoked | Revoked |
| Single sign-out [on web](v2-protocols-oidc.md#single-sign-out) | Revoked | Stays alive | Revoked | Stays alive | Stays alive |
