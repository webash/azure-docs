# Manage administrative units in Azure Active Directory

For more granular administrative control in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can assign users to an Azure AD role with a scope that's limited to one or more administrative units.


## Prerequisites

- Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license for each administrative unit administrator
- Azure AD Free licenses for administrative unit members
- Privileged Role Administrator or Global Administrator
- AzureAD module when using PowerShell
- Admin consent when using Graph explorer for Microsoft Graph API

For more information, see [Prerequisites to use PowerShell or Graph Explorer](prerequisites.md).

## Add an administrative unit

You can add an administrative unit by using either the Azure portal or PowerShell.

### Azure portal

1. In the Azure portal, go to Azure AD. Then, on the left pane, select **Administrative units**.

1. Select the **Add** button at the upper part of the pane, and then, in the **Name** box, enter the name of the administrative unit. Optionally, add a description of the administrative unit.

You can modify the values that are enclosed in quotation marks, as required.

### Microsoft Graph API

}
```

## Remove an administrative unit

In Azure AD, you can remove an administrative unit that you no longer need as a unit of scope for administrative roles.

### Azure portal

1. In the Azure portal, go to **Azure AD**, and then select **Administrative units**. 
1. Select the administrative unit to be deleted, and then select **Delete**. 
1. To confirm that you want to delete the administrative unit, select **Yes**. The administrative unit is deleted.

### PowerShell

```powershell
$adminUnitObj = Get-AzureADMSAdministrativeUnit -Filter "displayname eq 'DeleteMe Admin Unit'"
Remove-AzureADMSAdministrativeUnit -Id $adminUnitObj.Id
```

You can modify the values that are enclosed in quotation marks, as required for the specific environment.

### Microsoft Graph API
