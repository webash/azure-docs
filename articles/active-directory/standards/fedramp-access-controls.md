# Configure identity access controls to meet FedRAMP High Impact level

Access control is a major part of achieving a [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program](https://www.fedramp.gov/) (FedRAMP) High Impact level to operate.

The following list of controls and control enhancements in the access control (AC) family might require configuration in your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.

|Control family|Description|
| - | - |
| AC-02| Account management |
| AC-06| Least privilege |
| AC-07| Unsuccessful logon attempts |
| AC-08| System use notification |
| AC-10| Concurrent session control |
| AC-11| Session lock |
| AC-12| Session termination |
| AC-20| Use of external information systems |

Each row in the following table provides prescriptive guidance to help you develop your organization's response to any shared responsibilities for the control or control enhancement.
 
## Configurations

| Control ID   | Customer responsibilities and guidance |
| - | - |
| AC-02   | **Implement account lifecycle management for customer-controlled accounts. Monitor the use of accounts and notify account managers of account lifecycle events. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements every month for privileged access and every six months for nonprivileged access.**<p>Use Azure AD to provision accounts from external HR systems, on-premises Active Directory, or directly in the cloud. All account lifecycle operations are audited within the Azure AD audit logs. You can collect and analyze logs by using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution such as Azure Sentinel. Alternatively, you can use Azure Event Hubs to integrate logs with third-party SIEM solutions to enable monitoring and notification. Use Azure AD entitlement management with access reviews to ensure compliance status of accounts.<p>Provision accounts<br><li>[Plan cloud HR application to Azure Active Directory user provisioning](../app-provisioning/plan-cloud-hr-provision.md)<br><li>[Azure AD Connect sync: Understand and customize synchronization](../hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis.md)<br><li>[Add or delete users using Azure Active Directory](../fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory.md)<p>Monitor accounts<br><li>[Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal](../reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs.md)<br><li>[Connect Azure Active Directory data to Azure Sentinel](../../sentinel/connect-azure-active-directory.md) <br><li>[Tutorial: Stream logs to an Azure event hub](../reports-monitoring/tutorial-azure-monitor-stream-logs-to-event-hub.md)<p>Review accounts<br><li>[What is Azure AD entitlement management?](../governance/entitlement-management-overview.md)<br><li>[Create an access review of an access package in Azure AD entitlement management](../governance/entitlement-management-access-reviews-create.md)<br><li>[Review access of an access package in Azure AD entitlement management](../governance/entitlement-management-access-reviews-review-access.md)<p>Resources<br><li>[Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](../roles/permissions-reference.md)<br><li>[Dynamic Groups in Azure AD](../enterprise-users/groups-create-rule.md) |
| AC-02(1)| **Employ automated mechanisms to support management of customer-controlled accounts.**<p>Configure automated provisioning of customer-controlled accounts from external HR systems or on-premises Active Directory. For applications that support application provisioning, configure Azure AD to automatically create user identities and roles in cloud software as a solution (SaaS) applications that users need access to. In addition to creating user identities, automatic provisioning includes the maintenance and removal of user identities as status or roles change. To ease monitoring of account usage, you can stream Azure AD Identity Protection logs, which show risky users, risky sign-ins, and risk detections, and audit logs directly into Azure Sentinel or Event Hubs.<p>Provision<br><li>[Plan cloud HR application to Azure Active Directory user provisioning](../app-provisioning/plan-cloud-hr-provision.md)<br><li>[Azure AD Connect sync: Understand and customize synchronization](../hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis.md)<br><li>[What is automated SaaS app user provisioning in Azure AD?](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md)<br><li>[SaaS app integration tutorials for use with Azure AD](../saas-apps/tutorial-list.md)<p>Monitor and audit<br><li>[Investigate risk](../identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk.md)<br><li>[Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal](../reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs.md)<br><li>[What is Azure Sentinel?](../../sentinel/overview.md)<br><li>[Azure Sentinel: Connect data from Azure Active Directory](../../sentinel/connect-azure-active-directory.md)<br><li>[Tutorial: Stream Azure Active Directory logs to an Azure event hub](../reports-monitoring/tutorial-azure-monitor-stream-logs-to-event-hub.md)â€Ž|

| AC-02(5)| **Implement device log-out after a 15-minute period of inactivity.**<p>Implement device lock by using a conditional access policy that restricts access to compliant devices. Configure policy settings on the device to enforce device lock at the OS level with mobile device management (MDM) solutions such as Intune. Endpoint Manager or group policy objects can also be considered in hybrid deployments.

| AC-02(7)| **Administer and monitor privileged role assignments by following a role-based access scheme for customer-controlled accounts. Disable or revoke privilege access for accounts when no longer appropriate.**<p>Implement Azure AD Privileged Identity Management with access reviews for privileged roles in Azure AD to monitor role assignments and remove role assignments when no longer appropriate.

| AC-08| **Display and require user acknowledgment of privacy and security notices before granting access to information systems.**<p>With Azure AD, you can deliver notification or banner messages for all apps that require and record acknowledgment before granting access.  You can granularly target these terms of use policies to specific users (Member or Guest). You can also customize them per application via conditional access policies.<p>Terms of use<br><li>[Azure Active Directory terms of use](../conditional-access/terms-of-use.md)<br><li>[View report of who has accepted and declined](../conditional-access/terms-of-use.md) |
| AC-10|**Limit concurrent sessions to three sessions for privileged access and two for nonprivileged access.** <p>Nowadays, users connect from multiple devices, sometimes simultaneously. Limiting concurrent sessions leads to a degraded user experience and provides limited security value. A better approach to address the intent behind this control is to adopt a zero-trust security posture. Conditions are explicitly validated before a session is created and continually validated throughout the life of a session. <p>In addition, use the following compensating controls. <p>Use conditional access policies to restrict access to compliant devices.

Implement conditional access policies to restrict access from external systems. Conditional access policies might also be integrated with Cloud App Security to provide controls for cloud and on-premises applications from external systems.
