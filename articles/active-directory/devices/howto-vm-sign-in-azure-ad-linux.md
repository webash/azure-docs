# Preview: Login to a Linux virtual machine in Azure with Azure Active Directory using SSH certificate-based authentication

To improve the security of Linux virtual machines (VMs) in Azure, you can integrate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. You can now use Azure AD as a core authentication platform and a certificate authority to SSH into a Linux VM with AD and SSH certificate-based authentication. This functionality allows organizations to centrally control and enforce Azure role-based access control (RBAC) and Conditional Access policies that manage access to the VMs. This article shows you how to create and configure a Linux VM and login with Azure AD using SSH certificate-based authentication.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This capability is currently in public preview. [The previous version that made use of device code flow will be deprecated August 15, 2021](../../virtual-machines/linux/login-using-aad.md). To migrate from the old version to this version, see the section, [Migration from previous preview](#migration-from-previous-preview).
> This preview is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. Use this feature on a test virtual machine that you expect to discard after testing. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

There are many security benefits of using Azure AD with SSH certificate-based authentication to log in to Linux VMs in Azure, including:

- Use your Azure AD credentials to log in to Azure Linux VMs.
- Get SSH key based authentication without needing to distribute SSH keys to users or provision SSH public keys on any Azure Linux VMs you deploy. This experience is much simpler than having to worry about sprawl of stale SSH public keys that could cause unauthorized access.
- Reduce reliance on local administrator accounts, credential theft, and weak credentials.
- Password complexity and password lifetime policies configured for Azure AD help secure Linux VMs as well.
- With Azure role-based access control, specify who can login to a VM as a regular user or with administrator privileges. When users join or leave your team, you can update the Azure RBAC policy for the VM to grant access as appropriate. When employees leave your organization and their user account is disabled or removed from Azure AD, they no longer have access to your resources.
- With Conditional Access, configure policies to require multi-factor authentication and/or require client device you are using to SSH be a managed device (for example: compliant device or hybrid Azure AD joined) before you can SSH to Linux VMs. 
- Use Azure deploy and audit policies to require Azure AD login for Linux VMs and to flag use of non-approved local accounts on the VMs.
- Login to Linux VMs with Azure Active Directory also works for customers that use Federation Services.

## Supported Linux distributions and Azure regions

The following Linux distributions are currently supported during the preview of this feature when deployed in a supported region:

| Distribution | Version |
| --- | --- |
| CentOS | CentOS 7, CentOS 8.3 |

The following Azure regions are currently supported during the preview of this feature:

- Azure Global

> [!Note]
> The preview of this feature will be supported in Azure Government and Azure China by June of 2021.
 
It's not supported to use this extension on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. For more information, see [Support policies for AKS](../../aks/support-policies.md).

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.22.1 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Requirements for login with Azure AD using SSH certificate-based authentication

To enable Azure AD login using SSH certificate-based authentication for your Linux VMs in Azure, you need to ensure the following network, virtual machine, and client (ssh client) requirements are met.

### Network

VM network configuration must permit outbound access to the following endpoints over TCP port 443:

For Azure Global

- `https://packages.microsoft.com` – For package installation and upgrades.
- `http://169.254.169.254` – Azure Instance Metadata Service endpoint.
- `https://login.microsoftonline.com` – For PAM (pluggable authentication modules) based authentication flows.
- `https://pas.windows.net` – For Azure RBAC flows.

For Azure Government

- `https://packages.microsoft.com` – For package installation and upgrades.
- `http://169.254.169.254` – Azure Instance Metadata Service endpoint.
- `https://login.microsoftonline.us` – For PAM (pluggable authentication modules) based authentication flows.
- `https://pasff.usgovcloudapi.net` – For Azure RBAC flows.

For Azure China

- `https://packages.microsoft.com` – For package installation and upgrades.
- `http://169.254.169.254` – Azure Instance Metadata Service endpoint.
- `https://login.chinacloudapi.cn` – For PAM (pluggable authentication modules) based authentication flows.
- `https://pas.chinacloudapi.cn` – For Azure RBAC flows.

### Virtual machine

Ensure your VM is configured with the following functionality:

- System assigned managed identity. This option gets automatically selected when you use Azure portal to create VM and select Azure AD login option. You can also enable System assigned managed identity on a new or an existing VM using the Azure CLI.
- aadsshlogin and aadsshlogin-selinux (as appropriate). These packages get installed with the AADSSHLoginForLinux VM extension. The extension is installed when you use Azure portal to create VM and enable Azure AD login (Management tab) or via the Azure CLI.

### Client

Ensure your client meets the following requirements:

- SSH client must support OpenSSH based certificates for authentication. You can use Az CLI (2.21.1 or higher) or Azure Cloud Shell to meet this requirement. 
- SSH extension for Az CLI. You can install this using az. You do not need to install this extension when using Azure Cloud Shell as it comes pre-installed.
- If you are using any other SSH client other than Az CLI or Azure Cloud Shell that supports OpenSSH, you will still need to use Az CLI with SSH extension to retrieve ephemeral SSH cert in a config file and then use the config file with your SSH client.

## Enabling Azure AD login in for Linux VM in Azure

To use Azure AD login in for Linux VM in Azure, you need to first enable Azure AD login option for your Linux VM, configure Azure role assignments for users who are authorized to login in to the VM and then use SSH client that supports OpensSSH such as Az CLI or Az Cloud Shell to SSH to your Linux VM. There are multiple ways you can enable Azure AD login for your Linux VM, as an example you can use:

- Azure portal experience when creating a Linux VM
- Azure Cloud Shell experience when creating a Windows VM or for an existing Linux VM

### Using Azure portal create VM experience to enable Azure AD login

You can enable Azure AD login for any of the supported Linux distributions mentioned above using the Azure portal.

As an example, to create an Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS VM in Azure with Azure AD logon:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, with an account that has access to create VMs, and select **+ Create a resource**.
1. Click on **Create** under **Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS** in the **Popular** view.
1. On the **Management** tab, 
   1. Check the box to enable **Login with Azure Active Directory (Preview)**.
   1. Ensure **System assigned managed identity** is checked.
1. Go through the rest of the experience of creating a virtual machine. During this preview, you will have to create an administrator account with username and password/SSH public key.
 
### Using the Azure Cloud Shell experience to enable Azure AD login

Azure Cloud Shell is a free, interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. Common Azure tools are preinstalled and configured in Cloud Shell for you to use with your account. Just select the Copy button to copy the code, paste it in Cloud Shell, and then press Enter to run it. There are a few ways to open Cloud Shell:

- Select Try It in the upper-right corner of a code block.
- Open Cloud Shell in your browser.
- Select the Cloud Shell button on the menu in the upper-right corner of the Azure portal.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.22.1 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see the article Install Azure CLI.

1. Create a resource group with [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create).
1. Create a VM with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az_vm_create&preserve-view=true) using a supported distribution in a supported region.
1. Install the Azure AD login VM extension with [az vm extension set](/cli/azure/vm/extension?view=azure-cli-latest#az_vm_extension_set&preserve-view=true).

The following example deploys a VM named *myVM*, using *Ubuntu 18.04 LTS*, into a resource group named *AzureADLinuxVMPreview*, in the *southcentralus* region. It then installs the *Azure AD login VM extension* to enable Azure AD login for Linux VM. VM extensions are small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks on Azure virtual machines.

The example can be customized to support your testing requirements as needed.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name AzureADLinuxVMPreview --location southcentralus

az vm create \
    --resource-group AzureADLinuxVMPreview \
    --name myVM \	
    --image UbuntuLTS \
    --assign-identity \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys

az vm extension set \
    --publisher Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory \
    --name AADSSHLoginForLinux \
    --resource-group AzureADLinuxVMPreview \
    --vm-name myVM
```

It takes a few minutes to create the VM and supporting resources.

The AADSSHLoginForLinux extension can be installed on an existing (supported distribution) Linux VM with a running VM agent to enable Azure AD authentication. If deploying this extension to a previously created VM, ensure the machine has at least 1 GB of memory allocated else the extension will fail to install.

The provisioningState of Succeeded is shown once the extension is successfully installed on the VM. The VM must have a running [VM agent](../../virtual-machines/extensions/agent-linux.md) to install the extension.

## Configure role assignments for the VM

Now that you have created the VM, you need to configure Azure RBAC policy to determine who can log in to the VM. Two Azure roles are used to authorize VM login:

- **Virtual Machine Administrator Login**: Users with this role assigned can log in to an Azure virtual machine with administrator privileges.
- **Virtual Machine User Login**: Users with this role assigned can log in to an Azure virtual machine with regular user privileges.
 
To allow a user to log in to the VM over SSH, you must assign them either the Virtual Machine Administrator Login or Virtual Machine User Login role. An Azure user with the Owner or Contributor roles assigned for a VM do not automatically have privileges to Azure AD login to the VM over SSH. This separation is to provide audited separation between the set of people who control virtual machines versus the set of people who can access virtual machines. 

There are multiple ways you can configure role assignments for VM, as an example you can use:

- Azure AD Portal experience
- Azure Cloud Shell experience

> [!Note]
> The Virtual Machine Administrator Login and Virtual Machine User Login roles use dataActions and thus cannot be assigned at management group scope. Currently these roles can only be assigned at the subscription, resource group, or resource scope. It is recommended that the roles be assigned at the subscription or resource level and not at the individual VM level to avoid risk of running out of [Azure role assignments limit](../../role-based-access-control/troubleshooting.md#azure-role-assignments-limit) per subscription.

### Using Azure AD Portal experience

To configure role assignments for your Azure AD enabled Linux VMs:

1. Navigate to the virtual machine to be configured.
1. Select **Access control (IAM)** from the menu options.
1. Select **Add**, **Add role assignment** to open the Add role assignment pane.
1. In the **Role** drop-down list, select the role **Virtual Machine Administrator Login** or **Virtual Machine User Login**.
1. In the **Select** field, select a user, group, service principal, or managed identity. If you do not see the security principal in the list, you can type in the **Select** box to search the directory for display names, email addresses, and object identifiers.
1. Select **Save**, to assign the role.

After a few moments, the security principal is assigned the role at the selected scope.
 
### Using the Azure Cloud Shell experience

The following example uses [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az_role_assignment_create) to assign the Virtual Machine Administrator Login role to the VM for your current Azure user. The username of your current Azure account is obtained with [az account show](/cli/azure/account#az_account_show), and the scope is set to the VM created in a previous step with [az vm show](/cli/azure/vm#az_vm_show). The scope could also be assigned at a resource group or subscription level, normal Azure RBAC inheritance permissions apply.

```azurecli-interactive
username=$(az account show --query user.name --output tsv)
vm=$(az vm show --resource-group AzureADLinuxVMPreview --name myVM --query id -o tsv)

az role assignment create \
    --role "Virtual Machine Administrator Login" \
    --assignee $username \
    --scope $vm
```

> [!NOTE]
> If your Azure AD domain and logon username domain do not match, you must specify the object ID of your user account with the `--assignee-object-id`, not just the username for `--assignee`. You can obtain the object ID for your user account with [az ad user list](/cli/azure/ad/user#az_ad_user_list).

For more information on how to use Azure RBAC to manage access to your Azure subscription resources, see the article [Steps to assign an Azure role](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps.md).

## Install SSH extension for Az CLI

If you are using Azure Cloud Shell, then no other setup is needed as both the minimum required version of Az CLI and SSH extension for Az CLI are already included in the Cloud Shell environment.

Run the following command to add SSH extension for Az CLI

```azurecli
az extension add --name ssh
```

The minimum version required for the extension is 0.1.4. Check the installed SSH extension version with the following command.

```azurecli
az extension show --name ssh
```

## Using Conditional Access

You can enforce Conditional Access policies such as require MFA for the user, require compliant/Hybrid Azure AD joined device for the device running SSH client, check for low user and sign-in risk before authorizing access to Linux VMs in Azure that are enabled with Azure AD login in. 

To apply Conditional Access policy, you must select the "Azure Linux VM Sign-In" app from the cloud apps or actions assignment option and then use user and /or sign-in risk as a condition and Access controls as Grant access after satisfying require multi-factor authentication and/or require compliant/Hybrid Azure AD joined device.

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional Access policy enforcement requiring device compliance or Hybrid Azure AD join on the client device running SSH client only works with Az CLI running on Windows and macOS. It is not supported when using Az CLI on Linux or Azure Cloud Shell.

## Login using Azure AD user account to SSH into the Linux VM

### Using Az CLI

First do az login and then az ssh vm.

```azurecli
az login 
```

This command will launch a browser window and a user can sign in using their Azure AD account. 

The following example automatically resolves the appropriate IP address for the VM.

```azurecli
az ssh vm -n myVM -g AzureADLinuxVMPreview
```

If prompted, enter your Azure AD login credentials at the login page, perform an MFA, and/or satisfy device checks. You will only be prompted if your az CLI session does not already meet any required Conditional Access criteria. Close the browser window, return to the SSH prompt, and you will be automatically connected to the VM.

You are now signed in to the Azure Linux virtual machine with the role permissions as assigned, such as VM User or VM Administrator. If your user account is assigned the Virtual Machine Administrator Login role, you can use sudo to run commands that require root privileges.

### Using Az Cloud Shell

You can use Az Cloud Shell to connect to VMs without needing to install anything locally to your client machine. Start Cloud Shell by clicking the shell icon in the upper right corner of the Azure portal.
 
Az Cloud Shell will automatically connect to a session in the context of the signed in user. During the Azure AD Login for Linux Preview, **you must run az login again and go through an interactive sign in flow**.

```azurecli
az login
```

Then you can use the normal az ssh vm commands to connect using name and resource group or IP address of the VM.

```azurecli
az ssh vm -n myVM -g AzureADLinuxVMPreview
```

> [!NOTE]
> Conditional Access policy enforcement requiring device compliance or Hybrid Azure AD join is not supported when using Az Cloud Shell.

### Login using Azure AD service principal to SSH into the Linux VM

Azure CLI supports authenticating with a service principal instead of a user account. Since service principals are account not tied to any particular user, customers can use them to SSH to a VM to support any automation scenarios they may have. The service principal must have VM Administrator or VM User rights assigned. Assign permissions at the subscription or resource group level. 

The following example will assign VM Administrator rights to the service principal at the resource group level. Replace the service principal object ID, subscription ID, and resource group name fields.

```azurecli
az role assignment create \
    --role "Virtual Machine Administrator Login" \
    --assignee-object-id <service-principal-objectid> \
    --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal \
    --scope “/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroup-name>"
```

Use the following example to authenticate to Azure CLI using the service principal. To learn more about signing in using a service principal, see the article [Sign in to Azure CLI with a service principal](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli#sign-in-with-a-service-principal).

```azurecli
az login --service-principal -u <sp-app-id> -p <password-or-cert> --tenant <tenant-id>
```

Once authentication with a service principal is complete, use the normal Az CLI SSH commands to connect to the VM.

```azurecli
az ssh vm -n myVM -g AzureADLinuxVMPreview
```

### Exporting SSH Configuration for use with SSH clients that support OpenSSH

Login to Azure Linux VMs with Azure AD supports exporting the OpenSSH certificate and configuration, allowing you to use any SSH clients that support OpenSSH based certificates to sign in Azure AD. The following example exports the configuration for all IP addresses assigned to the VM.

```azurecli
az ssh config --file ~/.ssh/config -n myVM -g AzureADLinuxVMPreview
```

Alternatively, you can export the config by specifying just the IP address. Replace the IP address in the example with the public or private IP address for your VM. Type `az ssh config -h` for help on this command.

```azurecli
az ssh config --file ~/.ssh/config --ip 10.11.123.456
```

You can then connect to the VM through normal OpenSSH usage. Connection can be done through any SSH client that uses OpenSSH.

## Sudo and Azure AD login

Once, users assigned the VM Administrator role successfully SSH into a Linux VM, they will be able to run sudo with no other interaction or authentication requirement. Users assigned the VM User role will not be able to run sudo.

## Virtual machine scale set support

Virtual machine scale sets are supported, but the steps are slightly different for enabling and connecting to virtual machine scale set VMs.

First, create a virtual machine scale set or choose one that already exists. Enable a system assigned managed identity for your virtual machine scale set.

```azurecli
az vmss identity assign --vmss-name myVMSS --resource-group AzureADLinuxVMPreview
```

Install the Azure AD extension on your virtual machine scale set.

```azurecli
az vmss extension set --publisher Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory --name Azure ADSSHLoginForLinux --resource-group AzureADLinuxVMPreview --vmss-name myVMSS
```

Virtual machine scale set usually do not have public IP addresses, so you must have connectivity to them from another machine that can reach their Azure Virtual Network. This example shows how to use the private IP of a virtual machine scale set VM to connect. 

```azurecli
az ssh vm --ip 10.11.123.456
```

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot automatically determine the virtual machine scale set VM's IP addresses using the `--resource-group` and `--name` switches.

## Migration from previous preview

For customers who are using previous version of Azure AD login for Linux that was based on device code flow, complete the following steps.

1. Uninstall the AADLoginForLinux extension on the VM.
   1. Using Azure CLI: `az vm extension delete -g MyResourceGroup --vm-name MyVm -n AADLoginForLinux`
1. Enable System assigned managed identity on your VM.
   1. Using Azure CLI: `az vm identity assign -g myResourceGroup -n myVm`
1. Install the AADSSHLoginForLinux extension on the VM
   1. Using Azure CLI:
      ```azurecli
      az vm extension set \
                --publisher Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory \
                --name AADSSHLoginForLinux \
                --resource-group myResourceGroup \
                --vm-name myVM
      ```
## Using Azure Policy to ensure standards and assess compliance

Use Azure policy to ensure Azure AD login is enabled for your new and existing Linux virtual machines and assess compliance of your environment at scale on your Azure policy compliance dashboard. With this capability, you can use many levels of enforcement: you can flag new and existing Linux VMs within your environment that do not have Azure AD login enabled. You can also use Azure policy to deploy the Azure AD extension on new Linux VMs that do not have Azure AD login enabled, as well as remediate existing Linux VMs to the same standard. In addition to these capabilities, you can also use policy to detect and flag Linux VMs that have non-approved local accounts created on their machines. To learn more, review [Azure policy](https://www.aka.ms/AzurePolicy).

## Troubleshoot sign-in issues

Some common errors when you try to SSH with Azure AD credentials include no Azure roles assigned, and repeated prompts to sign in. Use the following sections to correct these issues.

### Could not retrieve token from local cache

You must run az login again and go through an interactive sign in flow. Review the section [Using Az Cloud Shell](#using-az-cloud-shell).

### Access denied: Azure role not assigned

If you see the following error on your SSH prompt, verify that you have configured Azure RBAC policies for the VM that grants the user either the Virtual Machine Administrator Login or Virtual Machine User Login role. If you are running into issues with Azure role assignments, see the article [Troubleshoot Azure RBAC](../../role-based-access-control/troubleshooting.md#azure-role-assignments-limit).

### Extension Install Errors

Installation of the AADSSHLoginForLinux VM extension to existing computers fails with one of the following known error codes:

#### Non-zero exit code: 22

The Status of the AADSSHLoginForLinux VM extension shows as Transitioning in the portal.

Cause 1: This failure is due to a System Assigned Managed Identity being required.

Solution 1: Perform these actions:

1. Uninstall the failed extension.
1. Enable a System Assigned Managed Identity on the Azure VM.
1. Run the extension install command again.

#### Non-zero exit code: 23

The Status of the AADSSHLoginForLinux VM extension shows as Transitioning in the portal.

Cause 1: This failure is due to the older AADLoginForLinux VM extension is still installed.

Solution 1: Perform these actions:

1. Uninstall the older AADLoginForLinux VM extension from the VM. The Status of the new AADSSHLoginForLinux VM extension will change to Provisioning succeeded in the portal.

#### Az ssh vm fails with KeyError: 'access_token'.

Cause 1: An outdated version of the Azure CLI client is being used.

Solution 1: Upgrade the Azure CLI client to version 2.21.0 or higher.

#### SSH Connection closed

After the user has successfully signed in using az login, connection to the VM using `az ssh vm -ip <addres>` or `az ssh vm --name <vm_name> -g <resource_group>` fails with *Connection closed by <ip_address> port 22*.

Cause 1: The user is not assigned to the either the Virtual Machine Administrator/User Login Azure RBAC roles within the scope of this VM.

Solution 1: Add the user to the either of the Virtual Machine Administrator/User Login Azure RBAC roles within the scope of this VM.

Cause 2: The user is in a required Azure RBAC role but the System Assigned managed identity has been disabled on the VM.

Solution 2: Perform these actions:

1. Enable the System Assigned managed identity on the VM.
1. Allow several minutes to pass before trying to connect using `az ssh vm --ip <ip_address>`.

### Virtual machine scale set Connection Issues

Virtual machine scale set VM connections may fail if the virtual machine scale set instances are running an old model. Upgrading virtual machine scale set instances to the latest model may resolve issues, especially if an upgrade has not been done since the Azure AD Login extension was installed. Upgrading an instance applies a standard virtual machine scale set configuration to the individual instance.
