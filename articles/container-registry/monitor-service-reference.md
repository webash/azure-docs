# Monitoring Azure Container Registry data reference

See [Monitor Azure Container Registry](monitor-service.md) for details on collecting and analyzing monitoring data for Azure Container Registry.

## Metrics

### Container Registry metrics

Resource Provider and Type: [Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md#microsoftcontainerregistryregistries)

| Metric | Exportable via Diagnostic Settings? | Unit | Aggregation Type | Description | Dimensions  |  
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:------------|:------------------|:----- |
|     AgentPoolCPUTime   | Yes |   Seconds   | Total |   CPU time used by [ACR tasks](container-registry-tasks-overview.md) running on dedicated [agent pools](tasks-agent-pools.md)	         | None | 
|     RunDuration   | Yes |  Milliseconds   |  Total |  Duration of [ACR tasks](container-registry-tasks-overview.md) runs       | None | 
|     StorageUsed   |  No | Bytes   |   Average | Storage used by the container registry<br/><br/>Sum of storage for unique and shared layers, manifest files, and replica copies in all repositories<sup>1</sup>	         | Geolocation | 
|     SuccessfulPullCount | Yes  |   Count   | Total | Successful pulls of container images and other artifacts from the registry	           | None | 
|     SuccessfulPushCount   | Yes |   Count   | Total | Successful pushes of container images and other artifacts to the registry          | None | 
|     TotalPullCount   |   Yes | Count   |     Total |  Total pulls of container images and other artifacts from the registry	      | None | 
|     TotalPushCount   | Yes |  Count   |   Total |  Total pushes of container images and other artifacts to the registry	        | None | 

<sup>1</sup>Because of layer sharing, registry storage used may be less than the sum of storage for individual repositories. When you [delete](container-registry-delete.md) a repository or tag, you recover only the storage used by manifest files and the unique layers referenced.

For more information, see a list of [all platform metrics supported in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md).

## Metric Dimensions

For more information on what metric dimensions are, see [Multi-dimensional metrics](../azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics.md#multi-dimensional-metrics).

Azure Container Registry has the following dimensions associated with its metrics.

| Dimension Name | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Geolocation** | The Azure region for a registry or [geo-replica](container-registry-geo-replication.md). |


## Resource logs

This section lists the types of resource logs you can collect for Azure Container Registry. 

For reference, see a list of [all resource logs category types supported in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema.md).

<sup>1</sup>Purge events are logged only if a registry [retention policy](container-registry-retention-policy.md) is configured.
