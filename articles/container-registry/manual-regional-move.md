# Manually move a container registry to another region

You might need to move an Azure container registry from one Azure region to another. For example, you may run a development pipeline or host a new deployment target in a different region, and want to provide a nearby registry.

While [Azure Resource Mover](../resource-mover/overview.md) can't currently automate a move for an Azure container registry, you can manually move a container registry to a different region:

* Export registry settings to a Resource Manager template
* Use the template to deploy a registry in a different Azure region
* Import registry content from the source registry to the target registry


[!INCLUDE [container-registry-geo-replication-include](../../includes/container-registry-geo-replication-include.md)]

## Prerequisites

Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

## Considerations

* Use steps in this article to move the registry to a different region in the same subscription. More configuration is needed to move a registry to a different Azure subscription or Active Directory tenant. 
* Exporting and using a Resource Manager template can help re-create many registry settings. You can edit the template to configure additional settings, or update the target registry after creation.

## Export template from source registry 

Use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or other Azure tools to export a Resource Manager template. To use the Azure portal:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your source registry.
1. In the menu, under **Automation**, select **Export template** > **Download**.

## Redeploy target registry in new region

### Modify template

Inspect the registry properties in the template JSON file you downloaded, and make necessary changes. At a minimum:

* Change the registry name's `defaultValue` to the desired name of the target registry
* Update the `location` to the desired Azure region for the target registry

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "registries_myregistry_name": {
            "defaultValue": "myregistry",
            "type": "String"
        }
    },
    "variables": {},
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries",
            "apiVersion": "2020-11-01-preview",
            "name": "[parameters('myregistry_name')]",
            "location": "centralus",
[...]
```

For more information, see [Use exported template from the Azure portal](../azure-resource-manager/templates/template-tutorial-export-template.md) and the [template reference](/azure/templates/microsoft.containerregistry/registries).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to encrypt the target registry using a customer-managed key, make sure to update the template with settings for the required managed identity, key vault, and key. You can only enable the customer-managed key when you deploy the registry.
> 
> For more information, see [Encrypt registry using customer-managed key](/container-registry-customer-managed-keys.md#enable-customer-managed-key---template).

### Create resource group 

Create a resource group for the target registry using the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create). The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location. 

```azurecli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

### Deploy target registry in new region

Use the [az deployment group create](/cli/azure/deployment/group#az_deployment_group_create) command to deploy the target registry, using the template:

```azurecli
az deployment group --resource-group myResourceGroup \
   --template-file template.json --name mydeployment
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you see errors during deployment, you might need to update certain configurations in the template file and retry the command.

## Import registry content in target registry

After creating the registry in the target region, use the [az acr import](/cli/azure/acr#az_acr_import) command, or the equivalent PowerShell command `Import-AzContainerImage`, to import images and other artifacts you want to preserve from the source registry to the target registry. For command examples, see [Import container images to a container registry](container-registry-import-images.md).

* Use the Azure CLI commands [az acr repository list](/cli/azure/acr/repository#az_acr_repository_list) and [az acr repository show-tags](/cli/azure/acr/repository#az_acr_repository_show_tags), or Azure PowerShell equivalents, to help enumerate the contents of your source registry.
* Run the import command for individual artifacts, or script it to run over a list of artifacts.

The following sample Azure CLI script enumerates the source repositories and tags and then imports the artifacts to a target registry. Modify as needed to import specific repositories or tags.

```azurecli
#!/bin/bash
# Modify registry names for your environment
SOURCE_REG=myregistry
TARGET_REG=targetregistry

# Get list of source repositories
REPO_LIST=$(az acr repository list \
    --name $SOURCE_REG --output tsv)

# Enumerate tags and import to target registry
for repo in $REPO_LIST; do
    TAGS_LIST=$(az acr repository show-tags --name $SOURCE_REG --repository $repo --output tsv);
    for tag in $TAGS_LIST; do
        echo "Importing $repo:$tag";
        az acr import --name $TARGET_REG --source $SOURCE_REG.azurecr.io/$repo":"$tag;
    done
done
```

## Verify target registry

Confirm the following information in your target registry:

* Registry settings such as the registry name, service tier, public access, and replications
* Repositories and tags for content that you want to preserve.


### Additional configuration

* If needed, manually configure settings in the target registry such as private endpoints, IP access rules, and managed identities.

* Update development and deployment systems to use the target registry instead of the source registry.

* Update any client firewall rules to allow access to the target registry.

## Delete original registry

After you have successfully deployed the target registry, migrated content, and verified registry settings, you may delete the source registry.

## Next steps

* Learn more about [importing container images](container-registry-import-images.md) to an Azure container registry from a public registry or another private registry. 
* See the [Resource Manager template reference](/azure/templates/microsoft.containerregistry/registries) for Azure Container Registry.
