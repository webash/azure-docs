# Azure Digital Twins high availability and disaster recovery

A key area of consideration for resilient IoT solutions is business continuity and disaster recovery. Designing for **High Availability (HA)** and **Disaster Recovery (DR)** can help you define and achieve appropriate uptime goals for your solution.

This article discusses the HA and DR features offered specifically by the Azure Digital Twins service.

Azure Digital Twins supports these feature options:
* *Intra-region HA* – Built-in redundancy to deliver on uptime of the service
* *Cross region DR* – Failover to a geo-paired Azure region in the case of an unexpected data center failure

You can also see the [Best practices](#best-practices) section for general Azure guidance about designing for HA/DR.

## Intra-region HA
 
Azure Digital Twins provides intra-region HA by implementing redundancies within the service. This is reflected in the [service SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/digital-twins) for uptime. **No additional work is required by the developers of an Azure Digital Twins solution to take advantage of these HA features.** Although Azure Digital Twins offers a reasonably high uptime guarantee, transient failures can still be expected, as with any distributed computing platform. Appropriate retry policies should be built in to the components interacting with a cloud application to deal with transient failures.

## Cross region DR

There could be some rare situations when a data center experiences extended outages due to power failures or other events in the region. Such events are rare, and during such failures, the intra region HA capability described above may not help. Azure Digital Twins addresses this with Microsoft-initiated failover.

**Microsoft-initiated failover** is exercised in rare situations to failover all the Azure Digital Twins instances from an affected region to the corresponding [geo-paired region](../best-practices-availability-paired-regions.md). This process is a default option (with no way for users to opt out), and requires no intervention from the user. Microsoft reserves the right to make a determination of when this option will be exercised. This mechanism doesn't involve user consent before the user's instance is failed over.

>[!NOTE]
> Some Azure services provide an additional option called **customer-initiated failover**, which enables customers to initiate a failover just for their instance, such as to run a DR drill. This mechanism is currently **not supported** by Azure Digital Twins. 

If it's important for you to keep all data within certain geographical areas, please check the location of the [geo-paired region](../best-practices-availability-paired-regions.md#azure-regional-pairs) for the region where you're creating your instance, to ensure that it meets your data residency requirements.

>[!NOTE]
> Some Azure services provide an option for users to configure a different region for failover, as a way to meet data residency requirements. This capability is currently **not supported** by Azure Digital Twins. 

## Monitor service health

As Azure Digital Twins instances are failed over and recovered, you can monitor the process using the [Azure Service Health](../service-health/service-health-overview.md) tool. Service Health tracks the health of your Azure services across different regions and subscriptions, and shares service-impacting communications about outages and downtimes.

During a failover event, Service Health can provide an indication of when your service is down, and when it's back up.

To view Service Health events...
1. Navigate to [Service Health](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Health/AzureHealthBrowseBlade/serviceIssues) in the Azure portal (you can use this link or search for it using the portal search bar).
1. Use the left menu to switch to the *Health history* page.
1. Look for an *Issue Name* beginning with **Azure Digital Twins**, and select it.

An issue called 'Azure Digital Twins - West Europe - Mitigated' is highlighted." lightbox="media/concepts-high-availability-disaster-recovery/navigate.png":::

1. For general information about the outage, view the *Summary* tab.

The tab displays general information." lightbox="media/concepts-high-availability-disaster-recovery/summary.png":::
1. For more information and updates on the issue over time, view the *Issue updates* tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/concepts-high-availability-disaster-recovery/issue-updates.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the 'Health History' page with the 'Issue updates' tab highlighted. The tab displays the status of entries." lightbox="media/concepts-high-availability-disaster-recovery/issue-updates.png":::


Note that the information displayed in this tool isn't specific to one Azure Digital instance. After using Service Health to understand what's going with the Azure Digital Twins service in a certain region or subscription, you can take monitoring a step further by using the [Resource health tool](troubleshoot-resource-health.md) to drill down into specific instances and see whether they're impacted.

## Best practices

For best practices on HA/DR, see the following Azure guidance on this topic: 
* The article [Azure Business Continuity Technical Guidance](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview) describes a general framework to help you think about business continuity and disaster recovery. 
* The [Disaster recovery and high availability for Azure applications](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/backup-and-recovery) paper provides architecture guidance on strategies for Azure applications to achieve High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR).
