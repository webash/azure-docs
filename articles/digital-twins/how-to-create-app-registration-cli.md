# Create an app registration to use with Azure Digital Twins (CLI)

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-create-app-registration-selector.md](../../includes/digital-twins-create-app-registration-selector.md)]

When working with an Azure Digital Twins instance, it is common to interact with that instance through client applications, such as a custom client app or a sample like [Azure Digital Twins Explorer](quickstart-azure-digital-twins-explorer.md). Those applications need to authenticate with Azure Digital Twins in order to interact with it, and some of the [authentication mechanisms](how-to-authenticate-client.md) that apps can use involve an [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) **app registration**.

This is not required for all authentication scenarios. However, if you are using an authentication strategy or code sample that does require an app registration, this article shows you how to set one up using the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli). It also covers how to [collect important values](#collect-important-values) that you'll need in order to use the app registration to authenticate.

## Azure AD app registrations

[Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. Setting up an **app registration** in Azure AD is one way to grant a client app access to Azure Digital Twins.

This app registration is where you configure access permissions to the [Azure Digital Twins APIs](concepts-apis-sdks.md). Later, client apps can authenticate against the app registration using the registration's **client and tenant ID values**, and as a result be granted the configured access permissions to the APIs.

>[!TIP]
> You may prefer to set up a new app registration every time you need one, *or* to do this only once, establishing a single app registration that will be shared among all scenarios that require it.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Create manifest

First, create a file containing certain service information that your app registration will need to access the Azure Digital Twins APIs. Later, you'll pass in this file when creating the app registration, to set up the Azure Digital Twins permissions.

Create a new .json file on your computer called **manifest.json**. Copy this text into the file:

```json
[
	{
		"resourceAppId": "0b07f429-9f4b-4714-9392-cc5e8e80c8b0",
		"resourceAccess": [
			{
				"id": "4589bd03-58cb-4e6c-b17f-b580e39652f8",
				"type": "Scope"
			}
		]
	}
]
```

The static value `0b07f429-9f4b-4714-9392-cc5e8e80c8b0` is the resource ID for the Azure Digital Twins service endpoint, which your app registration will need to access the Azure Digital Twins APIs.
 
Save the finished file.

### Upload to Cloud Shell

Next, upload the manifest file you just created to the Cloud Shell, so that you can access it in Cloud Shell commands when configuring the app registration.

To upload the file, go to the Cloud Shell window in your browser. Select the "Upload/Download files" icon and choose "Upload".

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-set-up-instance/cloud-shell/cloud-shell-upload.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Cloud Shell. The Upload icon is highlighted.":::

Navigate to the **manifest.json** file on your machine and select "Open." This will upload the file to the root of your Cloud Shell storage.

## Create the registration

In this section, you'll run a Cloud Shell command to create an app registration with the following settings:
* Name of your choice
* Available only to accounts in the default directory (single tenant)
* A web reply URL of `http://localhost`
* Read/write permissions to the Azure Digital Twins APIs

Run the following command to create the registration:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad app create --display-name <app-registration-name> --available-to-other-tenants false --reply-urls http://localhost --native-app --required-resource-accesses "@manifest.json"
```

The output of the command is information about the app registration you have created. 

## Verify success

You can confirm that the Azure Digital Twins permissions were granted by looking for the following fields in the output of the `az ad app create` command, and confirming their values match what's shown in the screenshot below:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-app-registration/cli-required-resource-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell output of the app registration creation command. The items under 'requiredResourceAccess' are highlighted: there's a 'resourceAppId' value of 0b07f429-9f4b-4714-9392-cc5e8e80c8b0, and a 'resourceAccess > id' value of 4589bd03-58cb-4e6c-b17f-b580e39652f8.":::

You can also verify the app registration was successfully created by using the Azure portal. For portal instructions, see [Verify success (portal)](how-to-create-app-registration-portal.md#verify-success).

## Collect important values

Next, collect some important values about the app registration that you'll need in order to use the app registration to authenticate a client application. These values include:
* **resource name**
* **client ID**
* **tenant ID**
* **client secret**

To work with Azure Digital Twins, the **resource name** is `http://digitaltwins.azure.net`.

The following sections describe how to find the other values.

### Collect client ID and tenant ID

To use the app registration for authentication, you may need to provide its **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**. In this section, you'll collect these values so you can save them and use them whenever they're needed.

You can find both of these values in the output from the `az ad app create` command.

Application (client) ID:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-app-registration/cli-app-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell output of the app registration creation command. The appId value is highlighted.":::

Directory (tenant) ID:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-app-registration/cli-tenant-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell output of the app registration creation command. The GUID value in the odata.metadata is highlighted.":::

### Collect client secret

To create a **client secret** for your app registration, you'll need your app registration's client ID value from the previous section. Use the value in the following CLI command to create a new secret:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad app credential reset --id <client-ID> --append
```

You can also add optional parameters to this command to specify a credential description, end date, and other details. For more information about the command and its additional parameters, see [az ad app credential reset documentation](/cli/azure/ad/app/credential?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true#az_ad_app_credential_reset).

The output of this command is information about the client secret that you've created. Copy the value for `password` to use when you need the client secret for authentication.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-app-registration/cli-client-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Cloud Shell output of the app registration creation command. The password value is highlighted.":::

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure to copy the value now and store it in a safe place, as it cannot be retrieved again. If you can't find the value later, you'll have to create a new secret.

## Other possible steps for your organization

It's possible that your organization requires additional actions from subscription Owners/administrators to successfully set up an app registration. The steps required may vary depending on your organization's specific settings.

Here are some common potential activities that an Owner or administrator on the subscription may need to perform.
* Grant admin consent for the app registration. Your organization may have **Admin Consent Required** globally turned on in Azure AD for all app registrations within your subscription. If so, the Owner/administrator may need to grant additional delegated or application permissions.
* Activate public client access by appending `--set publicClient=true` to a create or update command for the registration.
* Set specific reply URLs for web and desktop access using the `--reply-urls` parameter. For more information on using this parameter with `az ad` commands, see the [az ad app documentation](/cli/azure/ad/app?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true).
* Allow for implicit OAuth2 authentication flows using the `--oauth2-allow-implicit-flow` parameter. For more information on using this parameter with `az ad` commands, see the [az ad app documentation](/cli/azure/ad/app?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true).
