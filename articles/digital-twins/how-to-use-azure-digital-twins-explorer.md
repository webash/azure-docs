# Use Azure Digital Twins Explorer (preview)

[Azure Digital Twins Explorer](concepts-azure-digital-twins-explorer.md) is a tool for visualizing and working with Azure Digital Twins. This article describes the features of Azure Digital Twins Explorer, and how to use them to manage the data in your Azure Digital Twins instance. 

>[!NOTE]
>This tool is currently in **public preview**.

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-access-explorer.md](../../includes/digital-twins-access-explorer.md)]

### Switch contexts within the app

Once in the application, you're also able to change which instance is currently connected to the explorer, by selecting the instance name from the top toolbar.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/instance-url-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer. The instance name in the top toolbar is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/instance-url-1.png":::

This will bring up the **Azure Digital Twins URL modal**, where you can enter the host name of another Azure Digital Twins instance after the *https://* to connect to that instance.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/instance-url-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer. The Azure Digital Twins URL modal displays an editable box containing https:// and a host name." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/instance-url-2.png":::

>[!NOTE]
>At this time, the ability to switch contexts within the app is **not** available for personal Microsoft Accounts (MSA). MSA users will need to access the explorer from the correct instance in the Azure portal, or may connect to a certain instance through a [direct link to the environment](#link-to-your-environment).


## Query your digital twin graph

You can use the **Query Explorer** panel to perform [queries](concepts-query-language.md) on your graph.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/query-explorer-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer. The Query Explorer panel is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/query-explorer-panel.png":::

Enter the query you want to run and select the **Run Query** button. This will load the query results in the **Twin Graph** panel.

>[!NOTE]
> Query results containing relationships can only be rendered in the **Twin Graph** panel if the results include at least one twin as well. While queries that return only relationships are possible in Azure Digital Twins, you can only view them in Azure Digital Twins Explorer by using the [Output panel](#advanced-settings).

### Overlay query results

You can check the **Overlay results** box before running your query if you'd like the results to be highlighted from what is currently being shown in the **Twin Graph** panel, instead of completely replacing the panel's contents with the new query results.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/query-explorer-panel-overlay-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Query Explorer panel. The Overlay results box is checked, and two twins are highlighted in the larger graph that is shown in the Twin Graph panel." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/query-explorer-panel-overlay-results.png":::

If the query result includes something that is not currently being shown in the **Twin Graph** panel, the element will be added onto the existing view.

### Save and rerun queries

Queries can be saved in local storage in your browser, making them easy to select and rerun.

>[!NOTE]
>Local browser storage means that saved queries will not be available in other browsers apart from the one where you saved them, and they will remain in the browser storage indefinitely until the local storage is cleared.

To save a query, enter it into the query box and select the **Save** icon at the right of the panel. Enter a name for the saved query when prompted.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/query-explorer-panel-save.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Query Explorer panel. The Save icon is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/query-explorer-panel-save.png":::

Once the query has been saved, it is available to select from the **Saved Queries** dropdown menu to easily run it again.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/query-explorer-panel-saved-queries.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Query Explorer panel. The Saved Queries dropdown menu is highlighted and shows two sample queries." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/query-explorer-panel-saved-queries.png":::

To delete a saved query, select the **X** icon next to the name of the query when the **Saved Queries** dropdown menu is open.

>[!TIP]
>For large graphs, it's suggested to query only a limited subset and then load the remainder of the graph as required. You can double-click on a twin in the **Twin Graph** panel to retrieve additional related nodes.

## Explore the Twin Graph

The **Twin Graph** panel allows you to explore the twins and relationships in your instance.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer. The Twin Graph panel is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel.png":::

You can use this panel to [view your twins and relationships](#view-twins-and-relationships).

The Twin Graph panel also provides several abilities to customize your graph viewing experience:
* [Edit twin graph layout](#edit-twin-graph-layout)
* [Control twin graph expansion](#control-twin-graph-expansion)
* [Show and hide twin graph elements](#show-and-hide-twin-graph-elements)
* [Filter and highlight twin graph elements](#filter-and-highlight-twin-graph-elements)

### View twins and relationships

Run a query using the [Query Explorer](#query-your-digital-twin-graph) to see the twins and relationships in the query result displayed in the **Twin Graph** panel.

>[!TIP]
>The query to display all twins and relationships is `SELECT * FROM digitaltwins`.

#### View twin and relationship properties

To view the property values of a twin or a relationship, select the twin or relationship in the **Twin Graph** and use the **Toggle property inspector** button to expand the **Properties** panel. This panel will display all the properties associated with the element, along with their values. It also includes default values for properties that have not yet been set.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-highlight-graph-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The FactoryA twin is selected, and the Properties panel is expanded, showing the properties of the twin." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-highlight-graph-properties.png":::

Properties generally appear in white text, but may also appear in the following colors to indicate additional information:

* **Red text for model**: Indicates that the model for the twin can't be found. This can happen if the model has been deleted since the twin was created.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/properties-color-red.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Properties panel showing properties for a sample twin. The $model field and its value are shown with red text." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/properties-color-red.png":::

* **Yellow text for property**: Indicates that the property is not part of the model definition that the twin is using. This can happen if the model for the twin has been replaced or changed since the property was created, and the property no longer exists in the most recent version of the model. **Twins with outdated properties cannot be updated, unless the update also corrects or removes the outdated properties.**

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/properties-color-yellow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Properties panel showing properties for a sample twin. Several property names are shown with yellow text." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/properties-color-yellow.png":::

#### View a twin's relationships

You can also quickly view the code of all relationships that involve a certain twin (including incoming and outgoing relationships).

To do this, right-click a twin in the graph, and choose **Get relationships**. This brings up a **Relationship Information** modal displaying the [JSON representation](concepts-twins-graph.md#relationship-json-format) of all incoming and outgoing relationships.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-get-relationships.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The center of the screen displays a Relationship Information modal showing Incoming and Outgoing relationships." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-get-relationships.png":::

### Edit twin graph layout

You can rearrange the twins into different configurations by clicking and dragging them around the Twin Graph screen.

You can also apply one of several layout algorithms to the graph from the options in the **Run Layout** menu. 

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-layout.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The Run Layout button is highlighted, showing a menu with the layout options Cola, Dagre, fCoSE, and Klay." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-layout.png":::

### Control twin graph expansion

While viewing a query result in the **Twin Graph** panel, you can double-click a twin to have the graph fetch its relationships and related twins and display them if they're not already present in the view. You can customize this expansion by setting a size and direction to determine how many twins to fetch.

To set the number of layers to expand, use the **Expansion Level** option. This number indicates how many layers of relationships to fetch from the selected twin.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-expansion-level.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The Expansion Level button is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-expansion-level.png":::

To indicate which types of relationships to follow when expanding, use the **Expansion Mode** button. This allows you to select from just incoming, just outgoing, or both incoming and outgoing relationships.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-expansion-mode.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The Expansion Mode button is highlighted, showing a menu with the options In, Out, and In/Out." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-expansion-mode.png":::

### Show and hide twin graph elements

You can toggle the option to hide twins or relationships from the graph view. 

To hide a twin or relationship, right-click it in the **Twin Graph** window. This will bring up a menu with an option to hide the element or other related elements.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-hide.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The FactoryA twin is selected, and there is a menu containing options to Hide selected, Hide selected + Children, Hide all others, and Hide non children." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-hide.png":::

You can also hide multiple twins or relationships at once by using the CTRL/CMD or SHIFT keys to multi-select several elements of the same type in the graph. From here, follow the same right-click process to see the hide options.

To return to showing all twins after some have been hidden, use the **Show All** button. To return to showing all relationships, use the **Show All Relationships** button.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-show.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The Show All and Show All Relationships buttons are highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-show.png":::

### Filter and highlight twin graph elements

You can filter the twins and relationships that appear in the graph by text, by selecting this **Filter** icon:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-filter-text.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The text filter icon is selected, showing the Filter tab where you can enter a search term." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-filter-text.png":::

You can also highlight the twins and graph that appear in the graph by text, by selecting this **Highlight** icon:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-highlight-text.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The text filter icon is selected, showing the Highlight tab where you can enter a search term." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-highlight-text.png":::

## Manage twins and graph

Azure Digital Twins Explorer provides several ways to manage the [twins](concepts-twins-graph.md#digital-twins) and [relationships](concepts-twins-graph.md#relationships-a-graph-of-digital-twins) in your instance.

This section describes how to perform the following management activities:
* [Create twins](#create-twins), with or without initial properties
* [Create relationships](#create-relationships) between twins
* [Edit twins and relationships](#edit-twins-and-relationships)
* [Delete twins and relationships](#delete-twins-and-relationships)

For information about the viewing experience for twins and relationships, see [Explore twins and the Twin Graph](#explore-the-twin-graph).

### Create twins

You can create a new digital twin from its model definition in the **Models** panel.

To create a twin from a model, find that model in the list and choose the **Create a Twin** icon next to the model name. You'll be asked to enter a **name** for the new twin, which must be unique. Then save the twin, which will add it to your graph.

To add property values to your twin, see [Edit twins and relationships](#edit-twins-and-relationships).

### Create relationships

To create a relationship between two twins, start by selecting the source twin for the relationship in the **Twin Graph** window. Next, hold down a CTRL/CMD or SHIFT key while you select a second twin to be the target of the relationship.

Once the two twins are simultaneously selected, right-click either one of the twins. This will bring up a menu with an option to **Add relationships** between them.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-add-relationship.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The FactoryA and Consumer twins are selected, and a menu shows the option to Add relationships." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-add-relationship.png":::

This will bring up the **Create Relationship** dialog, which shows the source twin and target twin of the relationship, followed by a **Relationship** dropdown menu that contains the types of relationship that the source twin can have (defined in its DTDL model). Select an option for the relationship type, and **Save** the new relationship.

### Edit twins and relationships

To view the property values of a twin or a relationship, select the element in the **Twin Graph** and use the **Toggle property inspector** button to expand the **Properties** panel.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-highlight-graph-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel.

You can use these panels to [view your models](#view-models).

The Model Graph panel also provides several abilities to customize your graph viewing experience:
* [Edit model graph layout](#edit-model-graph-layout)
* [Filter and highlight model graph elements](#filter-and-highlight-model-graph-elements)
* [Upload model images](#upload-model-images) to represent models in the graphs

### View models

You can view a flat list of the models in your instance in the **Models** panel. This list is searchable using the **Search** bar in the panel.

You can use the **Model Graph** panel to view a graphical representation of the models in your instance, along with the relationships, inheritance, and components that connect them to each other.

#### View model definition

To see the full definition of a model, find that model in the **Models** pane and choose the **View Model** icon next to the model name. This will display a **Model Information** modal showing the raw DTDL definition of the model.

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Models panel. The View Model icon for a single model is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel-view.png":::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

You can also view a model's full definition by selecting it in the **Model Graph**, and using the **Toggle model details** button to expand the **MODEL DETAIL** panel. This panel will also display the full DTDL code for the model.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/model-graph-panel-highlight-graph-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Model Graph panel. The Floor model is selected, and the MODEL DETAILS panel is expanded, showing the DTDL code of the model." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/model-graph-panel-highlight-graph-details.png":::

### Edit model graph layout

You can rearrange the models into different configurations by clicking and dragging them around the Model Graph screen.

You can also apply one of several layout algorithms to the model graph from the options in the **Run Layout** menu. 

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/model-graph-panel-layout.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Model Graph panel. The Run Layout button is highlighted, showing a menu with the layout options Cola, Dagre, fCoSE, Klay, and d3Force." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/model-graph-panel-layout.png":::

### Filter and highlight model graph elements

You can filter the types of connections that appear in the Model Graph. Turning off one of the connection types via the switches in this menu will prevent that connection type from displaying in the graph.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/model-graph-panel-filter-connections.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Model Graph panel. The filter menu for Relationships, Inheritance, and Components are highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/model-graph-panel-filter-connections.png":::

You can also filter the models and connections that appear in the graph by text, by selecting this **Filter** icon:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/model-graph-panel-filter-text.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Model Graph panel. The text filter icon is selected, showing the Filter tab where you can enter a search term." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/model-graph-panel-filter-text.png":::

You can highlight the models and connections that appear in the graph by text, by selecting this **Highlight** icon:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/model-graph-panel-highlight-text.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Model Graph panel. The text filter icon is selected, showing the Highlight tab where you can enter a search term." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/model-graph-panel-highlight-text.png":::

### Upload model images

You can upload custom images to represent different models in the Model Graph and [Twin Graph](#explore-the-twin-graph) views. You can upload images for individual models, or for several models at once.

>[!NOTE]
>These images are stored in local browser storage. This means that the images will not be available in other browsers apart from the one where you saved them, and they will remain in the browser storage indefinitely until the local storage is cleared.

To upload an image for a single model, find that model in the **Models** panel and choose the **Upload Model Image** icon next to the model name. In the file selector box that appears, navigate on your machine to the image file you want to upload for that model. Choose **Open** to upload it.

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel-upload-one-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Models panel. The Upload Model Image icon for a single model is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel-upload-one-image.png":::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

You can also upload model images in bulk.

First, use the following instructions to set the image file names before uploading. This enables Azure Digital Twins Explorer to automatically assign the images to the correct models after upload. 
1. Start with the model ID value (for example, `dtmi:example:Floor;1`)
1. Replace instances of ":" with "_" (the example becomes `dtmi_example_Floor;1`)
1. Replace instances of ";" with "-" (the example becomes `dtmi_example_Floor-1`)
1. Make sure the file has an image extension (the example becomes something like `dtmi_example_Floor-1.png`)

> [!NOTE]
> If you try to upload an image that does not map to any existing model using the criteria above, the image will not be uploaded or stored.

Then, to upload the images at the same time, use the **Upload Model Images** icon at the top of the Models panel. In the file selector box, choose which image files to upload. 

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel-upload-images.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Models panel.

    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Manage models

You can use the **Models** panel on the left side of the Azure Digital Twins Explorer screen to perform management activities on the entire set of models, or on individual models. 

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer. The Models panel is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel.png":::

With this panel, you can complete the following model management activities:
* [Upload models](#upload-models) into your Azure Digital Twins instance
* [Delete models](#delete-models) from your instance
* [Refresh models](#refresh-models) to reload the list of all models into this panel

For information about the viewing experience for models, see [Explore models and the Model Graph](#explore-models-and-the-model-graph).

### Upload models

You can upload models from your machine by selecting them individually, or by uploading an entire folder of models at once.

To upload one or more models that are individually selected, select the **Upload a model** icon showing an arrow pointing up into a cloud.

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel-upload.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Models panel. The Upload a model icon is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel-upload.png":::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

In the file selector box that appears, navigate on your machine to the model(s) you want to upload. You can select one or more JSON model files and select **Open** to upload them.

To upload a folder of models, including everything that's inside it, select the **Upload a directory of Models** icon showing a file folder.

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel-upload-directory.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Models panel. The Upload a directory of Models icon is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel-upload-directory.png":::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

In the file selector box that appears, navigate on your machine to a folder containing JSON model files. Select **Open** to upload that top-level folder and all of its contents.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If a model references another model in its definition, like when you're defining relationships or components, the model being referenced needs to be present in the instance in order to upload the model that uses it. If you're uploading models one-by-one, that means that you should upload the model being referenced **before** uploading any models that use it. If you're uploading models in bulk, you can select them both in the same import and Azure Digital Twins will infer the order to upload them in.

### Delete models

You can use the Models panel to delete individual models, or all of the models in your instance at once.

To delete a single model, find that model in the list and choose the **Delete Model** icon next to the model name.

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/models-panel-delete-one.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Models panel.

## Import/export graph

From the **Twin Graph** panel, you have the options to [import](#import-graph) and [export](#export-graph-and-models) graph features.

### Import graph

You can use the import feature to add twins, relationships, and models to your instance. This can be useful for creating many twins, relationships, and/or models at once.

#### Create import file

The first step in importing a graph is creating a file representing the twins and relationships you want to add.

The import file can be in either of these two formats:
* The **custom Excel-based format** described in the remainder of this section. This allows you to upload twins and relationships.
* The **JSON-based format** generated on [graph export](#export-graph-and-models). This can contain twins, relationships, and/or models.

To create a custom graph in Excel, use the following format.

Each row represents an element to create: either a twin, a relationship, or a combination of twin and corresponding relationship.
Use the following columns to structure the twin or relationship data. The column names can be customized, but they should remain in this order.

| ModelID | ID | Relationship (source) | Relationship Name | Init Data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Optional*<br>The DTMI model ID for a twin that should be created.<br><br>You can leave this column blank for a row if you want that row to create only a relationship (no twins). | *Required*<br>The unique ID for a twin.<br><br>If a new twin is being created in this row, this will be the ID of the new twin.<br>If there is relationship information in the row, this ID will be used as the **target** of the relationship. | *Optional*<br>The ID of a twin that should be the **source** twin for a new relationship.<br><br>You can leave this column blank for a row if you want that row to create only a twin (no relationships). | *Optional*<br>The name for the new relationship to create. The relationship direction will be **from** the twin in column C **to** the twin in column B. | *Optional*<br>A JSON string containing property settings for the twin to be created. The properties must match those defined in the model from column A. |

Here is an example .xlsx file creating a small graph of two floors and two rooms.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/import-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot of graph data in Excel. The column headers correspond to the fields above, in order, and the rows contain corresponding data values." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/import-example.png":::

You can view this file and additional .xlsx graph examples in the [Azure Digital Twins Explorer repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-explorer/tree/main/client/examples) on GitHub.

>[!NOTE]
>The properties and relationships described in the .xlsx must match what's defined in the model definitions for the related twins.

#### Import file to Azure Digital Twins Explorer

Once you have a file on your machine that's ready to be imported, select the **Import Graph** icon in the Twin Graph panel.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-import.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The Import Graph button is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-import.png":::

In the file selector box that appears, navigate on your machine to the graph file (.xlsx or .json) that you want to upload and choose **Open** to upload it.

Azure Digital Twins will open an **Import** panel showing a preview of the graph to be imported. To confirm, select the **Save** icon in the upper-right corner of the panel.

If import is successful, a modal window will display the number of models, twins, and relationships that were uploaded.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-import-successful.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The center of the screen displays an Import Successful modal showing 4 twins imported and 2 relationships imported." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-import-successful.png":::

### Export graph and models

You can use the export feature to export partial or complete graphs, including models, twins, and relationships. Export serializes the twins and relationships from the most recent query results, as well as all models in the instance, to a JSON-based format that you can download to your machine.

To begin, use the [Query Explorer](#query-your-digital-twin-graph) panel to run a query that selects the twins and relationships that you want to download. This will populate them in the Twin Graph panel.

>[!TIP]
>The query to display all twins and relationships is `SELECT * FROM digitaltwins`.

Once the Twin Graph panel is showing the portion of the graph you want to download, select the **Export Graph** icon.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-export.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Digital Twins Explorer Twin Graph panel. The Export Graph button is highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/twin-graph-panel-export.png":::

This action enables a **Download** link in the Twin Graph box. Select it to download a JSON-based representation of the query result, and all the models in your instance, to your machine.

>[!TIP]
>This file can be edited and/or re-uploaded to Azure Digital Twins through the [import](#import-graph) feature.

## Link to your environment

You can share your Azure Digital Twins Explorer environment with others to collaborate on work. This section describes how to send your Azure Digital Twins Explorer environment to someone else and verify they have the permissions to access it.

To share your environment, you can send a link to the recipient that will open an Azure Digital Twins Explorer window connected to your instance. Use the link below and replace the placeholders for your **tenant ID** and the **host name** of your Azure Digital Twins instance. 

`https://explorer.digitaltwins.azure.net/?tid=<tenant-ID>&eid=<Azure-Digital-Twins-host-name>`

>[!NOTE]
> The value for the host name placeholder is **not** preceded by *https://* here.

Here is an example of a URL with the placeholder values filled in:

`https://explorer.digitaltwins.azure.net/?tid=00a000aa-00a0-00aa-0a0aa000aa00&eid=ADT-instance.api.wcus.digitaltwins.azure.net`

For the recipient to view the instance in the resulting Azure Digital Twins Explorer window, they must log into their Azure account, and have **Azure Digital Twins Data Reader** access to the instance (you can read more about Azure Digital Twins roles in [Concepts: Security](concepts-security.md)). For the recipient to make changes to the graph and the data, they must have the **Azure Digital Twins Data Owner** role on the instance.

### Link with a query

You may want to share an environment and specify a query to execute upon landing, to highlight a subgraph or custom view for a teammate. To do this, start with the URL for the environment and add the query text to the URL as a querystring parameter:

`https://explorer.digitaltwins.azure.net/?tid=<tenant-ID>&eid=<Azure-Digital-Twins-host-name>&query=<query-text>`

The query text should be URL encoded. 

>[!TIP]
>You can copy the query text from the **Query Explorer** window and paste it into the URL window in the correct spot at the end of the URL. Submitting this URL should convert the query text to use the proper URL encoding.
>
> You can also use an independent URL encoder to convert the query text.

Here's an example of the parameter for a query to **SELECT * FROM digitaltwins**:

`...&query=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20digitaltwins`

You can then share the completed URL.

## Advanced settings

You can enable several advanced setting options for Azure Digital Twins Explorer.

Clicking the settings cog in the top right corner allows the configuration of the following advanced features:
* **Eager Loading**: *Accessible via the **Settings** cog in the top toolbar*. When a query returns twins that have relationships to other twins that **are not** included in the query results, this feature will load the "missing" twins before rendering the graph.
* **Caching**: *Accessible via the **Settings** cog in the top toolbar*. When this feature is enabled, Azure Digital Twins Explorer will keep a local cache of relationships and models in memory to improve query performance. These caches are cleared on any write operations on the relevant elements, as well as on browser refresh.
* **Console**: *Accessible via the **Settings** cog in the top toolbar*. This feature enables display of a console window, capable of using simple shell functions for working with the graph.
* **Output**: *Accessible via the **Settings** cog in the top toolbar*. This feature enables display of an output window, which shows a diagnostic trace of operations.
* **Customize panel layout**: You can edit the position of the panels that make up Azure Digital Twins Explorer (Query Explorer, Models, Twin Graph, Model Graph). To move a panel to a different location, click and hold the panel name, and drag it to its new desired position.

The names of the Query Explorer, Models, Twin Graph, and Model Graph panels are highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-use-azure-digital-twins-explorer/panels.png":::

    The panel positions will be reset upon refresh of the browser window.
