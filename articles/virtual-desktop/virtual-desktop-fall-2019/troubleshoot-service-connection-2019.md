## Provide feedback

You can give us feedback and discuss the Azure Virtual Desktop Service with the product team and other active community members at the [Azure Virtual Desktop Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Virtual-Desktop/bd-p/WindowsVirtualDesktop).

## User connects but nothing is displayed (no feed)

A user can start Remote Desktop clients and is able to authenticate, however the user doesn't see any icons in the web discovery feed.

Confirm that the user reporting the issues has been assigned to application groups by using this command line:

```PowerShell
Get-RdsAppGroupUser <tenantname> <hostpoolname> <appgroupname>
```

Confirm that the user is logging in with the correct credentials.

If the web client is being used, confirm that there are no cached credentials issues.
