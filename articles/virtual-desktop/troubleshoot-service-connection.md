# Azure Virtual Desktop service connections

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This content applies to Azure Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager Azure Virtual Desktop objects. If you're using Azure Virtual Desktop (classic) without Azure Resource Manager objects, see [this article](./virtual-desktop-fall-2019/troubleshoot-service-connection-2019.md).

Use this article to resolve issues with Azure Virtual Desktop client connections.

## Provide feedback

You can give us feedback and discuss the Azure Virtual Desktop Service with the product team and other active community members at the [Azure Virtual Desktop Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Virtual-Desktop/bd-p/WindowsVirtualDesktop).

## User connects but nothing is displayed (no feed)

A user can start Remote Desktop clients and is able to authenticate, however the user doesn't see any icons in the web discovery feed.

1. Confirm that the user reporting the issues has been assigned to application groups by using this command line:

     ```powershell
     Get-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName <userupn>
     ```

2. Confirm that the user is signing in with the correct credentials.

3. If the web client is being used, confirm that there are no cached credentials issues.

4. If the user is part of an Azure Active Directory (AD) user group, make sure the user group is a security group instead of a distribution group. Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't support Azure AD distribution groups.

## User loses existing feed and no remote resource is displayed (no feed)

This error usually appears after a user moved their subscription from one Azure AD tenant to another. As a result, the service loses track of their user assignments, since those are still tied to the old Azure AD tenant.

To resolve this, all you need to do is reassign the users to their app groups.

This could also happen if a CSP Provider created the subscription and then transferred to the customer. To resolve this re-register the Resource Provider.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Go to **Subscription**, then select your subscription.
3. In the menu on the left side of the page, select **Resource provider**.
4. Find and select **Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization**, then select **Re-register**.
