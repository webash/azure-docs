# Facility Ontology

Facility ontology defines how Azure Maps Creator internally stores facility data in a Creator dataset.  In addition to defining internal facility data structure, facility ontology is also exposed externally through the WFS API. When WFS API is used to query facility data in a dataset, the response format is defined by the ontology supplied to that dataset.

At a high level, facility ontology divides the dataset into feature classes. All feature classes share a common set of properties, such as `ID` and `Geometry`.  In addition to the common property set, each feature class defines a set of properties. Each property is defined by its data type and constraints. Some feature classes have properties that are dependent on other feature classes. Dependant properties evaluate to the `ID` of another feature class.

### Major Changes

:::zone pivot="facility-ontology-v1"

Fixed the following constraint validation checks:

* Constraint validation check for exclusivity of `isObstruction = true` *or* the presence of `obstructionArea` for `lineElement` and `areaElement` feature classes.

* Constraint validation check for exclusivity of `isRoutable = true` *or* the presence of `routeThroughBehavior` for the `category` feature class.
:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="facility-ontology-v2"

* Added a structure feature class to hold walls, columns, and so on.
* Cleaned up the attributes designed to enrich routing scenarios. The current routing engine doesn't support them.
