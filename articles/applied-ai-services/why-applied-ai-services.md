# Why Azure Applied AI Services?

Azure Applied AI Services reduces the time developers need to modernize business processes from months to days. These services help you accelerate time to value for specific business scenarios through a combination of Azure Cognitive Services, task-specific AI, and business logic.  ​

Each Azure Applied AI service addresses a common need and generates new opportunities across organizations such as analyzing conversations for improved customer experiences, automating document processing for operational productivity, understanding the root cause of anomalies for protecting your organization’s growth, and extracting insights from content ranging from documents to videos.

By building on top of the AI models from Azure Cognitive Services as well as providing task-specific AI models and built-in business logic, Azure Applied AI Services enable developers to quickly deploy common scenarios versus building from scratch.

## Benefits ​​
-	Modernize business process – Use task-specific AI to solve your scenario
-	Accelerate development – Go live with your AI solutions quickly
-	Run responsibly anywhere – Enterprise-grade responsible and secure services from the cloud to the edge 
 

## What is the difference between Applied AI Services and  Cognitive Services? 
 
Both Applied AI Services and Cognitive Services are designed to help developers create intelligent apps. Cognitive Services provides general purpose AI services that serve as the core engine for Applied AI Services.  
 
Applied AI Services builds on top of Cognitive Services while also adding task-specific AI and business logic to optimize for specific use cases so that developers spend less time designing solutions or setting up pipelines.  
 
If there isn’t an Applied AI Service available to meet a specific use case, developers can also build their own solutions from scratch, using Cognitive Services as building blocks.
