# HADR configuration best practices (SQL Server on Azure VMs)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlvm](../../includes/appliesto-sqlvm.md)]

A [Windows Server Failover Cluster](hadr-windows-server-failover-cluster-overview.md) is used for high availability and disaster recovery (HADR) with SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). 

This article provides cluster configuration best practices for both [failover cluster instances (FCIs)](failover-cluster-instance-overview.md) and [availability groups](availability-group-overview.md) when you use them with SQL Server on Azure VMs. 

To learn more, see the other articles in this series: [Checklist](performance-guidelines-best-practices-checklist.md), [VM size](performance-guidelines-best-practices-vm-size.md), [Storage](performance-guidelines-best-practices-storage.md), [Security](security-considerations-best-practices.md), [HADR configuration](hadr-cluster-best-practices.md), [Collect baseline](performance-guidelines-best-practices-collect-baseline.md). 

## Checklist

Review the following checklist for a brief overview of the HADR best practices that the rest of the article covers in greater detail. 

For your Windows cluster, consider these best practices: 

* Change the cluster to less aggressive parameters to avoid unexpected outages from transient network failures or Azure platform maintenance. To learn more, see [heartbeat and threshold settings](#heartbeat-and-threshold). For Windows Server 2012 and later, use the following recommended values: 
   - **SameSubnetDelay**:  1 second
   - **SameSubnetThreshold**: 40 heartbeats
   - **CrossSubnetDelay**: 1 second
   - **CrossSubnetThreshold**:  40 heartbeats
* Place your VMs in an availability set or different availability zones.  To learn more, see [VM availability settings](#vm-availability-settings). 
* Use a single NIC per cluster node and a single subnet. 
* Configure cluster [quorum voting](#quorum-voting) to use 3 or more odd number of votes. Do not assign votes to DR regions. 
* Carefully monitor [resource limits](#resource-limits) to avoid unexpected restarts or failovers due to resource constraints.
   - Ensure your OS, drivers, and SQL Server are at the latest builds. 
   - Optimize performance for SQL Server on Azure VMs. Review the other sections in this article to learn more. 
   - Reduce or spread out workload to avoid resource limits. 
   - Move to a VM or disk that his higher limits to avoid constraints. 

For your SQL Server availability group or failover cluster instance, consider these best practices: 

* If you're experiencing frequent unexpected failures, follow the performance best practices outlined in the rest of this article. 
* If optimizing SQL Server VM performance does not resolve your unexpected failovers, consider [relaxing the monitoring](#relaxed-monitoring) for the availability group or failover cluster instance. However, doing so may not address the underlying source of the issue and could mask symptoms by reducing the likelihood of failure. You may still need to investigate and address the underlying root cause. For Windows Server 2012 or higher, use the following recommended values: 
   - **Lease timeout**: Use this equation to calculate the maximum lease time out value:   
   `Lease timeout < (2 * SameSubnetThreshold * SameSubnetDelay)`.   
   Start with 40 seconds. If you're using the relaxed `SameSubnetThreshold` and `SameSubnetDelay` values recommended previously, do not exceed 80 seconds for the lease timeout value.   
   - **Max failures in a specified period**: Set this value to 6. 
* When using the virtual network name (VNN) to connect to your HADR solution, specify `MultiSubnetFailover = true` in the connection string, even if your cluster only spans one subnet. 
   - If the client does not support `MultiSubnetFailover = True` you may need to set `RegisterAllProvidersIP = 0` and `HostRecordTTL = 300` to cache client credentials for shorter durations. However, doing so may cause additional queries to the DNS server. 
- To connect to your HADR solution using the distributed network name (DNN), consider the following:
   - You must use a client driver that supports `MultiSubnetFailover = True`, and this parameter must be in the connection string. 
   - Use a unique DNN port in the connection string when connecting to the DNN listener for an availability group. 
- Use a database mirroring connection string for a basic availability group to bypass the need for a load balancer or DNN. 
- Validate the sector size of your VHDs before deploying your high availability solution to avoid having misaligned I/Os. See [KB3009974](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb3009974-fix-slow-synchronization-when-disks-have-different-sector-sizes-for-primary-and-secondary-replica-log-files-in-sql-server-ag-and-logshipping-environments-ed181bf3-ce80-b6d0-f268-34135711043c) to learn more. 


## VM availability settings

To reduce the impact of downtime, consider the following VM best availability settings: 

* Use proximity placement groups together with accelerated networking for lowest latency.
* Place virtual machine cluster nodes in separate availability zones to protect from datacenter-level failures or in a single availability set for lower-latency redundancy within the same datacenter.
* Use premium-managed OS and data disks for VMs in an availability set.
* Configure each application tier into separate availability sets.

## Quorum

Although a two-node cluster will function without a [quorum resource](/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/understand-quorum), customers are strictly required to use a quorum resource to have production support. Cluster validation won't pass any cluster without a quorum resource. 

Technically, a three-node cluster can survive a single node loss (down to two nodes) without a quorum resource. But after the cluster is down to two nodes, there's a risk that the clustered resources will go offline if a node loss or communication failure to prevent a split-brain scenario. Configuring a quorum resource will allow the cluster to continue online with only one node online.

The disk witness is the most resilient quorum option, but to use a disk witness on a SQL Server on Azure VM, you must use an Azure Shared Disk which imposes some limitations to the high availability solution. As such, use a disk witness when you're configuring your failover cluster instance with Azure Shared Disks, otherwise use a cloud witness whenever possible. 

The following table lists the quorum options available for SQL Server on Azure VMs: 

|  |[Cloud witness](/windows-server/failover-clustering/deploy-cloud-witness) |[Disk witness](/windows-server/failover-clustering/manage-cluster-quorum#configure-the-cluster-quorum) |[File share witness](/windows-server/failover-clustering/manage-cluster-quorum#configure-the-cluster-quorum)  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**Supported OS**| Windows Server 2016+ |All | All|

- The **cloud witness** is ideal for deployments in multiple sites, multiple zones, and multiple regions. Use a cloud witness whenever possible, unless you're using a shared-storage cluster solution.
- The **disk witness** is the most resilient quorum option and is preferred for any cluster that uses Azure Shared Disks (or any shared-disk solution like shared SCSI, iSCSI, or fiber channel SAN).  A Clustered Shared Volume cannot be used as a disk witness. 
- The **fileshare witness** is suitable for when the disk witness and cloud witness are unavailable options. 

To get started, see [Configure cluster quorum](hadr-cluster-quorum-configure-how-to.md). 

## Quorum Voting

It's possible to change the quorum vote of a node participating in a Windows Server Failover Cluster. 

When modifying the node vote settings, follow these guidelines: 

| Qurom voting guidelines |
|-|
| Start with each node having no vote by default. Each node should only have a vote with explicit justification.|
| Enable votes for cluster nodes that host the primary replica of an availability group, or the preferred owners of a failover cluster instance. |
| Enable votes for automatic failover owners. Each node that may host a primary replica or FCI as a result of an automatic failover should have a vote. | 
| If an availability group has more than one secondary replica, only enable votes for the replicas that have automatic failover. | 
| Disable votes for nodes that are in secondary disaster recovery sites. Nodes in secondary sites should not contribute to the decision of taking a cluster offline if there's nothing wrong with the primary site. | 
| Have an odd number of votes, with three quorum votes minimum. Add a [quorum witness](hadr-cluster-quorum-configure-how-to.md) for an additional vote if necessary in a two-node cluster. | 
| Reassess vote assignments post-failover. You don't want to fail over into a cluster configuration that doesn't support a healthy quorum. |


## Connectivity


It's possible to configure either a virtual network name (VNN), or starting with SQL Server 2019, a distributed network name (DNN) for both failover cluster instances and availability group listeners. 

The distributed network name is the recommended connectivity option, when available: 
- The end-to-end solution is more robust since you no longer have to maintain the load balancer resource. 
- Eliminating the load balancer probes minimizes failover duration. 
- The DNN simplifies provisioning and management of the failover cluster instance or availability group listener with SQL Server on Azure VMs. 

If you're using using DNN, or using an AG or FCI that spans across multiple subnets, you must use a client driver that supports the MultiSubnetFailover parameter, and specify MultiSubnetFailover=True in the connection string. For availability groups, the connection string should contain the DNN port number (not required for FCI). 

To learn more, see the [Windows Server Failover Cluster overview](hadr-windows-server-failover-cluster-overview.md#virtual-network-name-vnn). 

To configure connectivity, see the following articles:
- Availability group:  [Configure DNN](availability-group-distributed-network-name-dnn-listener-configure.md), [Configure VNN](availability-group-vnn-azure-load-balancer-configure.md)
- Failover cluster instance: [Configure DNN](failover-cluster-instance-distributed-network-name-dnn-configure.md), [Configure VNN](failover-cluster-instance-vnn-azure-load-balancer-configure.md). 

Most SQL Server features work transparently with FCI and availability groups when using the DNN, but there are certain features that may require special consideration. See [FCI and DNN interoperability](failover-cluster-instance-dnn-interoperability.md) and [AG and DNN interoperability](availability-group-dnn-interoperability.md) to learn more. 

>[!TIP]
> Set the MultiSubnetFailover parameter = true in the connection string even for HADR solutions that span a single subnet to support future spanning of subnets without the need to update connection strings.  

## Heartbeat and threshold 

Change the cluster heartbeat and threshold settings to relaxed settings. The default heartbeat and threshold cluster settings are designed for highly tuned on-premises networks and do not consider the possibility of increased latency in a cloud environment. The heartbeat network is maintained with UDP 3343, which is traditionally far less reliable than TCP and more prone to incomplete conversations.
 
Therefore, when running cluster nodes for SQL Server on Azure VM high availability solutions, change the cluster settings to a more relaxed monitoring state to avoid transient failures due to the increased possibility of network latency or failure, Azure maintenance, or hitting resource bottlenecks. 

The delay and threshold settings have a cumulative effect to total health detection. For example, setting *CrossSubnetDelay* to send a heartbeat every 2 seconds and setting the *CrossSubnetThreshold* to 10 missed heartbeats before taking recovery means the cluster can have a total network tolerance of 20 seconds before recovery action is taken. In general, continuing to send frequent heartbeats but having greater thresholds is preferred. 

To ensure recovery during legitimate outages while providing greater tolerance for transient issues, relax your delay and threshold settings to the recommended values detailed in the following table: 

| Setting | Windows Server 2012 or later | Windows Server 2008R2 |
|:---------------------|:----------------------------|:-----------------------|
| SameSubnetDelay      | 1 second                    | 2 second               |
| SameSubnetThreshold  | 40 heartbeats               | 10 heartbeats (max)         |
| CrossSubnetDelay     | 1 second                    | 2 second               |  
| CrossSubnetThreshold | 40 heartbeats               | 20 heartbeats (max)         |


Use PowerShell to change your cluster parameters: 

# [Windows Server 2012-2019](#tab/windows2012)


```powershell
(get-cluster).SameSubnetThreshold = 40
(get-cluster).CrossSubnetThreshold = 40
```

# [Windows Server 2008/R2](#tab/windows2008)


```powershell
(get-cluster).SameSubnetThreshold = 10
(get-cluster).CrossSubnetThreshold = 20 
(get-cluster).SameSubnetDelay = 2000
(get-cluster).CrossSubnetDelay = 2000
```

---

Use PowerShell to verify your changes: 

```powershell
get-cluster | fl *subnet*
```

Consider the following: 

* This change is immediate, restarting the cluster or any resources is not required. 
* Same subnet values should not be greater than cross subnet values. 
* SameSubnetThreshold <= CrossSubnetThreshold
* SameSubnetDelay <= CrossSubnetDelay

Choose relaxed values based on how much down time is tolerable and how long before a corrective action should occur depending on your application,  business needs, and your environment. If you're not able to exceed the default Windows Server 2019 values, then at least try to match them, if possible: 

For reference, the following table details the default values: 


| Setting | Windows Server 2019 |  Windows Server 2016 |    Windows Server 2008 - 2012 R2 |
|:---------------------|:----------------|   ------------|:----------------------------|
| SameSubnetDelay      | 1 second        | 1 second       | 1 second                    |
| SameSubnetThreshold  | 20 heartbeats   | 10 heartbeats  | 5 heartbeats               |
| CrossSubnetDelay     | 1 second        | 1 second     | 1 second                    |
| CrossSubnetThreshold | 20 heartbeats   | 10 heartbeats   | 5 heartbeats               |


To learn more, see [Tuning Failover Cluster Network Thresholds](/windows-server/troubleshoot/iaas-sql-failover-cluster).

## Relaxed monitoring

If tuning your cluster heartbeat and threshold settings as recommended is insufficient tolerance and you're still seeing failures due to transient issues rather than true outages, you can configure your AG or FCI monitoring to be more relaxed. In some scenarios, it may be beneficial to temporarily relax the monitoring for a period of time given the level of activity. For example, you may want to relax the monitoring when you're doing IO intensive workloads such as database backups, index maintenance, DBCC CHECKDB, etc. Once the activity is complete, set your monitoring to less relaxed values. 

> [!WARNING]
> Changing these settings may mask an underlying problem, and should be used as a temporary solution to reduce, rather than eliminate, the likelihood of failure. Underlying issues should still be investigated and addressed. 

Start by increase the following parameters from their default values for relaxed monitoring, and adjust as necessary: 


|Parameter |Default value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Healthcheck timeout**|60000 |Determines health of the primary replica or node. The cluster resource DLL sp_server_diagnostics returns results at an interval that equals 1/3 of the health-check timeout threshold. If sp_server_diagnostics is slow or is not returning information, the resource DLL will wait for the full interval of the health-check timeout threshold before determining that the resource is unresponsive, and initiating an automatic failover, if configured to do so. |
|**Failure-Condition Level** |  2  | Conditions that trigger an automatic failover. There are five failure-condition levels, which range from the least restrictive (level one) to the most restrictive (level five)  |

Use Transact-SQL (T-SQL) to modify the health check and failure conditions for both AGs and FCIs. 

For availability groups: 

```sql
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP AG1 SET (HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT =60000);
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP AG1 SET (FAILURE_CONDITION_LEVEL = 2);
```

For failover cluster instances: 

```sql
ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET FAILOVER CLUSTER PROPERTY HealthCheckTimeout = 60000;
ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET FAILOVER CLUSTER PROPERTY FailureConditionLevel = 2; 
```

Specific to **availability groups**, start with the following recommended parameters, and adjust as necessary: 

|Parameter |Default value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Lease timeout**|40000|Prevents split-brain. |
|**Session timeout**|20 |Checks communication issues between replicas. The session-timeout period is a replica property that controls how long (in seconds) that an availability replica waits for a ping response from a connected replica before considering the connection to have failed. By default, a replica waits 10 seconds for a ping response. This replica property applies to only the connection between a given secondary replica and the primary replica of the availability group. |
| **Max failures in specified period** | 6 | Used to avoid indefinite movement of a clustered resource within multiple node failures. Too low of a value can lead to the availability group being in a failed state. Increase the value to prevent short disruptions from performance issues as too low a value can lead to the AG being in a failed state. | 

Before making any changes, consider the following: 
- Do not lower any timeout values below their default values. 
- Use this equation to calculate the maximum lease time out value:   
 `Lease timeout < (2 * SameSubnetThreshold * SameSubnetDelay)`.   
  Start with 40 seconds. If you're using the relaxed `SameSubnetThreshold` and `SameSubnetDelay` values recommended previously, do not exceed 80 seconds for the lease timeout value.    
- For synchronous-commit replicas, changing session-timeout to a high value can increase HADR_sync_commit waits.

**Lease timeout** 

Use the **Failover Cluster Manager** to modify the **lease timeout** settings for your availability group. See the SQL Server [availability group lease health check](/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-group-lease-healthcheck-timeout#lease-timeout) documentation for detailed steps.

**Session timeout** 

Use Transact-SQL (T-SQL) to modify the **session timeout** for an availability group: 

```sql
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP AG1
MODIFY REPLICA ON 'INSTANCE01' WITH (SESSION_TIMEOUT = 15);
```

**Max failures in specified period**

Use the Failover Cluster Manager to modify the **Max failures in specified period** value: 
1. Select **Roles** in the navigation pane.
1. Under **Roles**, right-click the clustered resource and choose **Properties**. 
1. Select the **Failover** tab, and increase the **Max failures in specified period** value as desired. 

## Resource limits

VM or disk limits could result in a resource bottleneck that impacts the health of the cluster, and impedes the health check. If you're experiencing issues with resource limits, consider the following: 

* Ensure your OS, drivers, and SQL Server are at the latest builds.
* Optimize SQL Server on Azure VM environment as described in the [performance guidelines](performance-guidelines-best-practices-checklist.md) for SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines
* Reduce or spread out the workload to reduce utilization without exceeding resource limits
* Tune the SQL Server workload if there is any opportunity, such as
    * Add/optimize indexes
    * Update statistics if needed and if possible, with Full scan  
    * Use features like resource governor (starting with SQL Server 2014, enterprise only) to limit resource utilization during specific workloads, such as backups or index maintenance. 
* Move to a VM or disk that has higher limits to meet or exceed the demands of your workload. 

## Networking

Use a single NIC per server (cluster node) and a single subnet. Azure networking has physical redundancy, which makes additional NICs and subnets unnecessary on an Azure virtual machine guest cluster. The cluster validation report will warn you that the nodes are reachable only on a single network. You can ignore this warning on Azure virtual machine guest failover clusters.

The non-RFC-compliant DHCP service in Azure can cause the creation of certain failover cluster configurations to fail. This failure happens because the cluster network name is assigned a duplicate IP address, such as the same IP address as one of the cluster nodes. This is an issue when you use availability groups, which depend on the Windows failover cluster feature.

Consider the scenario when a two-node cluster is created and brought online:

1. The cluster comes online, and then NODE1 requests a dynamically assigned IP address for the cluster network name.
2. The DHCP service doesn't give any IP address other than NODE1's own IP address, because the DHCP service recognizes that the request comes from NODE1 itself.
3. Windows detects that a duplicate address is assigned both to NODE1 and to the failover cluster's network name, and the default cluster group fails to come online.
4. The default cluster group moves to NODE2. NODE2 treats NODE1's IP address as the cluster IP address and brings the default cluster group online.
5. When NODE2 tries to establish connectivity with NODE1, packets directed at NODE1 never leave NODE2 because it resolves NODE1's IP address to itself. NODE2 can't establish connectivity with NODE1, and then loses quorum and shuts down the cluster.
6. NODE1 can send packets to NODE2, but NODE2 can't reply. NODE1 loses quorum and shuts down the cluster.

You can avoid this scenario by assigning an unused static IP address to the cluster network name in order to bring the cluster network name online. For example, you can use a link-local IP address like 169.254.1.1. To simplify this process, see [Configuring Windows failover cluster in Azure for availability groups](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/14776.configuring-windows-failover-cluster-in-windows-azure-for-alwayson-availability-groups.aspx).

For more information, see [Configure availability groups in Azure (GUI)](./availability-group-quickstart-template-configure.md).


## Known issues

Review the resolutions for some commonly known issues and errors: 

**Cluster node removed from membership**


If the [Windows Cluster heartbeat and threshold settings](#heartbeat-and-threshold) are too aggressive for your environment, you may see following message in the system event log frequently. 

```
Error 1135
Cluster node 'Node1' was removed from the active failover cluster membership. 
The Cluster service on this node may have stopped. This could also be due to the node having 
lost communication with other active nodes in the failover cluster. Run the Validate a 
Configuration Wizard to check your network configuration. If the condition persists, check 
for hardware or software errors related to the network adapters on this node. Also check for 
failures in any other network components to which the node is connected such as hubs, switches, or bridges.
```


For more information, review [Troubleshooting cluster issue with Event ID 1135.](/windows-server/troubleshoot/troubleshooting-cluster-event-id-1135)


**Lease has expired** / **Lease is no longer valid**


If [monitoring](#relaxed-monitoring) is too aggressive for your environment, you may see frequent AG or FCI restarts, failures, or failovers. Additionally for availability groups, you may see the following messages in the SQL Server error log: 

```
Error 19407: The lease between availability group 'PRODAG' and the Windows Server Failover Cluster has expired. 
A connectivity issue occurred between the instance of SQL Server and the Windows Server Failover Cluster. 
To determine whether the availability group is failing over correctly, check the corresponding availability group 
resource in the Windows Server Failover Cluster
```

```
Error 19419: The renewal of the lease between availability group '%.*ls' and the Windows Server Failover Cluster 
failed because the existing lease is no longer valid. 
``` 

**Connection timeout**

If the **session timeout** is too aggressive for your availability group environment, you may see following messages frequently:

```
Error 35201: A connection timeout has occurred while attempting to establish a connection to availability 
replica 'replicaname' with ID [availability_group_id]. Either a networking or firewall issue exists, 
or the endpoint address provided for the replica is not the database mirroring endpoint of the host server instance.
```

```
Error 35206
A connection timeout has occurred on a previously established connection to availability 
replica 'replicaname' with ID [availability_group_id]. Either a networking or a firewall issue 
exists, or the availability replica has transitioned to the resolving role. 
```

**Not failing over group**



If the **Maximum Failures in the Specified Period** value is too low and you're experiencing intermittent failures due to transient issues, your availability group could end in a failed state. Increase this value to tolerate more transient failures. 

```
Not failing over group <Resource name>, failoverCount 3, failoverThresholdSetting <Number>, computedFailoverThreshold 2. 
```
