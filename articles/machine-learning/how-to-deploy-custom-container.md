# Deploy a TensorFlow model served with TF Serving using a custom container in a managed online endpoint (preview)

Learn how to deploy a custom container as a managed online endpoint in Azure Machine Learning.

Custom container deployments can use web servers other than the default Python Flask server used by Azure Machine Learning. Users of these deployments can still take advantage of Azure Machine Learning's built-in monitoring, scaling, alerting, and authentication.

> [!WARNING]
> Microsoft may not be able to help troubleshoot problems caused by a custom image. If you encounter problems, you may be asked to use the default image or one of the images Microsoft provides to see if the problem is specific to your image.

## Prerequisites

* Install and configure the Azure CLI and ML extension. For more information, see [Install, set up, and use the 2.0 CLI (preview)](how-to-configure-cli.md). 

* You must have an Azure resource group, in which you (or the service principal you use) need to have `Contributor` access. You'll have such a resource group if you configured your ML extension per the above article. 

* You must have an Azure Machine Learning workspace. You'll have such a workspace if you configured your ML extension per the above article.

* If you've not already set the defaults for Azure CLI, you should save your default settings. To avoid having to repeatedly pass in the values, run:

   ```azurecli
   az account set --subscription <subscription id>
   az configure --defaults workspace=<azureml workspace name> group=<resource group>

* To deploy locally, you must have [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) running locally. This step is **highly recommended**. It will help you debug issues.

## Download source code

To follow along with this tutorial, download the source code below.

```azurecli-interactive
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples --depth 1
cd azureml-examples/cli
```

## Initialize environment variables

Define environment variables:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-tfserving.sh" id="initialize_variables":::

## Download a TensorFlow model

Download and unzip a model that divides an input by two and adds 2 to the result:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-tfserving.sh" id="download_and_unzip_model":::

## Run a TF Serving image locally to test that it works

Use docker to run your image locally for testing:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-tfserving.sh" id="run_image_locally_for_testing":::

### Check that you can send liveness and scoring requests to the image

First, check that the container is "alive," meaning that the process inside the container is still running. You should get a 200 (OK) response.

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-tfserving.sh" id="check_liveness_locally":::

Then, check that you can get predictions about unlabeled data:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-tfserving.sh" id="check_scoring_locally":::

### Stop the image

Now that you've tested locally, stop the image:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-tfserving.sh" id="stop_image":::

## Create a YAML file for your endpoint

You can configure your cloud deployment using YAML. Take a look at the sample YAML for this endpoint:

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/custom-container/tfserving-endpoint.yml":::

There are a few important concepts to notice in this YAML:

### Readiness route vs. liveness route

An HTTP server can optionally define paths for both _liveness_ and _readiness_. A liveness route is used to check whether the server is running. A readiness route is used to check whether the server is ready to do some work. In machine learning inference, a server could respond 200 OK to a liveness request before loading a model. The server could respond 200 OK to a readiness request only after the model has been loaded into memory.

Review the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) for more information about liveness and readiness probes.

Notice that this deployment uses the same path for both liveness and readiness, since TF Serving only defines a liveness route.

### Locating the mounted model

When you deploy a model as a real-time endpoint, Azure Machine Learning _mounts_ your model to your endpoint. Model mounting enables you to deploy new versions of the model without having to create a new Docker image. By default, a model registered with the name *foo* and version *1* would be located at the following path inside of your deployed container: `/var/azureml-app/azureml-models/foo/1`

So, for example, if you have the following directory structure on your local machine:

```
azureml-examples
  cli
    endpoints
      online
        custom-container
          half_plus_two
          tfserving-endpoint.yml    
```     

and `tfserving-endpoint.yml` contains:

```
model:
    name: tfserving-mounted
    version: 1
    local_path: ./half_plus_two
```

then your model will be located at the following location in your endpoint:

```
var 
  azureml-app
    azureml-models
      tfserving-endpoint
        1
          half_plus_two
```

### Create the endpoint

Now that you've understood how the YAML was constructed, create your endpoint. This command can take a few minutes to complete.

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-tfserving.sh" id="create_endpoint":::

### Invoke the endpoint

Once your deployment completes, see if you can make a scoring request to the deployed endpoint.

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-tfserving.sh" id="invoke_endpoint":::

### Delete endpoint and model

Now that you've successfully scored with your endpoint, you can delete it:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-tfserving.sh" id="delete_endpoint_and_model":::
