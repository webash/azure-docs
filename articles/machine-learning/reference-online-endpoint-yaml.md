# Managed online endpoints (preview) YAML reference 

The Azure CLI extension for Azure Machine Learning (CLI 2.0) uses YAML documents to provide configuration for many commands. In this article, learn about the YAML document used when working with managed online endpoints.

For more information on deploying a model, see [How to deploy managed online endpoints](how-to-deploy-managed-online-endpoints.md).

[!INCLUDE [preview disclaimer](../../includes/machine-learning-preview-generic-disclaimer.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> A fully specified sample YAML for managed online endpoints is available for [reference](https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineEndpoint.template.yaml)

## Schema

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $schema    | \[__Optional__\] The YAML schema. You can view the schema in the above example in a browser to see all available options in the YAML file.|
| name       | Name of the endpoint. Needs to be unique at the Azure region level.|
| traffic | Percentage of traffic from endpoint to divert to each deployment. Traffic values need to sum to 100. |
| auth_mode | use `key` for key based authentication and `aml_token` for Azure Machine Learning token-based authentication. `key` doesn't expire but `aml_token` does. Get the most recent token with the `az ml endpoint list-keys` command). |
| identity | Used to configure system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities. |
| app_insights_enabled | `True` to enable integration with Azure AppInsights associated with your Azure Machine Learning workspace. `False` by default.
| tags | Dictionary of Azure Tags to be associated with the Endpoint. |
| description | Description of the endpoint. |
| target | If this key isn't defined, the endpoint will be deployed as a managed online endpoint. To use AKS, set the value of this key to the name of the registered compute target, such as `target:azureml:my-aks`. 
| deployments | Contains a list of deployments to be created in the endpoint. In this case, we have only one deployment, named `blue`. |

### Attributes of the `deployments` key
 
| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| name  | The name of the deployment. |
| model | The name of the registered model version in the form `model: azureml:my-model:1`. You can also specify model properties inline: `name`, `version`, and `local_path`. The model files will be uploaded and registered automatically. A downside of inline specification is that you must increment the version manually if you want to update the model files.|
| code_configuration.code.local_path | The directory that contains all the Python source code for scoring the model. Nested directories/packages are supported. |
| code_configuration.scoring_script | The Python file in the above scoring directory. This Python code must have an `init()` function and a `run()` function. The function `init()` will be called after the model is created or updated (you can use it to cache the model in memory, and so forth). The `run()` function is called at every invocation of the endpoint to do the actual scoring/prediction. |
| environment | Contains the details of the Azure Machine Learning environment to host the model and code. As a best practice for production, you should separately register the model and environment and specify the registered name and version in the YAML. For example, `environment: azureml:my-env:1`. |
| instance_type | The VM SKU to host your deployment instances. For more information, see [Managed online endpoints supported VM SKUs](reference-managed-online-endpoints-vm-sku-list.md).|
| scale_settings.scale_type | Currently, this value must be `manual`. To scale up or scale down after the endpoint and deployment are created, update the `instance_count` in the YAML and run the command `az ml endpoint update -n $ENDPOINT_NAME --file <yaml filepath>`. |
| scale_settings.instance_count | The number of instances in the deployment. Base the value on the workload you expect. For high availability, Microsoft recommends you set it to at least `3`. |
| scale_settings.min_instances | The minimum number of instances to always be present. |
| scale_settings.max_instances | The maximum number of instances that the deployment can scale to. The quota will be reserved for max_instances. |
| request_settings.request_timeout_ms | The scoring timeout in milliseconds. The default value is 5000 for managed online endpoints. |
| request_settings.max_concurrent_requests_per_instance | The number of maximum concurrent requests per node allowed per deployment. Defaults to 1. __Do not change this setting from the default value of 1 unless instructed by Microsoft Technical Support or a member of Azure Machine Learning team.__ |
| request_settings.max_queue_wait_ms | The maximum amount of time a request will stay in the queue (in milliseconds). Defaults to 500. |
| liveness_probe | Liveness probe monitors the health of the container regularly. |
| liveness_probe.period | How often (in seconds) to perform the liveness probe. Defaults to 10 seconds. Minimum value is 1. |
| liveness_probe.initial_delay | The number of seconds after the container has started before liveness probes are initiated. Defaults to 10. |
| liveness_probe.timeout | The number of seconds after which the liveness probe times out. Defaults to 2 seconds. Minimum value is 1. |
| liveness_probe.failure_threshold | The system will try failure_threshold times before giving up. Defaults to 30. Minimum value is 1. |
| liveness_probe.success_threshold | The minimum consecutive successes for the liveness probe to be considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Minimum value is 1. |
| readiness_probe | Readiness probe validates if the container is ready to serve traffic. The properties and defaults are the same as liveness probe. |
| tags | A dictionary of Azure Tags you want associated with the deployment. |
| description | A description of the deployment. |
