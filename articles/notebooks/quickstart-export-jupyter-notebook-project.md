# What happened to Azure Notebooks? 

[!INCLUDE [notebooks-status](../../includes/notebooks-status.md)]

## Recreate a notebook environment

If you'd like to create an environment that matches that of the retired Azure Notebooks Preview, you can use the script file provided in GitHub.

1. Navigate to the Azure Notebooks [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureNotebooks) or [directly access the environment folder](https://aka.ms/aznbrequirementstxt).
1. From a command prompt, navigate to the directory you want to use for your projects.
1. Download the environment folder contents and follow the README instructions to install the Azure Notebooks package dependencies.

## Other offers at Microsoft
If you have existing Jupyter Notebooks or want to start a new project, you can use them with many of Microsoft's offerings.

- [Azure Machine Learning](../machine-learning/how-to-run-jupyter-notebooks.md): an end-to-end machine learning platform to enable users to build and deploy models faster on Azure. Azure ML allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks on a VM or a shared cluster computing environment.

- [Azure Lab Services](../lab-services/class-type-jupyter-notebook.md): If you're looking for a way to work with Jupyter Notebooks and cloud compute in a tailored classroom environment, Lab Services is a great option.
