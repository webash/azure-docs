# What are application templates?

Application templates in Azure IoT Central are a tool to help you kickstart your IoT solution development. You can use app templates for everything from getting a feel for what is possible, to fully customizing your application to resell to your customers.

Application templates consist of:

- Sample operator dashboards
- Sample device templates
- Simulated devices producing real-time data
- Pre-configured rules and jobs
- Rich documentation including tutorials and how-tos

You choose the application template when you create your application. You can't change the template after the application is created.

## Custom templates

If you want to create your application from scratch, choose the **Custom application** template. The custom application template id is `iotc-pnp-preview`.

## Industry focused templates

Azure IoT Central is an industry agnostic application platform. Application templates are industry focused examples available for these industries today:
