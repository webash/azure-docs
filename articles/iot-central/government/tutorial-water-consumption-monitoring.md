    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/iotcentral-government-tab-overview1.png" alt-text="Build government app templates.":::
  

1. Select the **Water consumption monitoring** application template.
This template includes a sample water consumption device template, a simulated device, an operator dashboard, and preconfigured monitoring rules.

1. Select **Create app** to open the **New application** creation form with the following fields:
    * **Application name**: By default, the application uses *Water consumption monitoring* followed by a unique ID string that Azure IoT Central generates. Optionally, choose a friendly application name. You can change the application name later, too.
    * **URL**: Azure IoT Central autogenerates a URL based on the application name. You can choose to update the URL to your liking. You can change the URL later, too.
    * If you have an Azure subscription, enter your **Directory**, **Azure subscription**, and **Location** information. If you don't have a subscription, you can select the **7-day free trial** option and complete the required contact information.

1. Select **Create** at the bottom of the page.

    ![Azure IoT Central Billing info page](./media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/new-application-water-consumption-monitoring-billing-info.png)

You've now created a water consumption monitoring app by using the Azure IoT Central water consumption monitoring template.

The water consumption monitoring application comes with preconfigured:

* Sample operator dashboards.
* Sample predefined water flow and valve device templates.
* Simulated water flow and smart valve devices.
* Rules and jobs.
* Sample branding.

It's your application, and you can modify it anytime. Next, you explore the application and make some customizations.

## Explore and customize the operator dashboard

After you create the application, the sample **Wide World water consumption dashboard** opens.
  
 :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/water-consumption-monitoring-dashboard-full.png" alt-text="Water consumption monitoring dashboard.":::


You can create and customize views on the dashboard for operators.

> [!NOTE]
> All data displayed on the dashboard is based on simulated device data, which you will explore in the next section.
  
The dashboard consists of different kinds of tiles:

* **Wide World Water Utility image tile**: The first tile in the dashboard is an image tile of the fictitious water utility Wide World Water. You can customize the tile by inserting your own image or removing it.
* **Average water flow KPI tile**: The KPI tile is configured to display as an example *the average in the last 30 minutes*. You can customize the KPI tile and set it to a different type and time range.
* **Device command tiles**: These tiles include the **Close valve**, **Open valve**, and **Set valve position** tiles. Selecting the commands takes you to the simulated device command page. In Azure IoT Central, a *command* is a *device capability* type. We'll explore this concept later in the [Device template](../government/tutorial-water-consumption-monitoring.md#explore-the-device-template) section of this tutorial.

* **Water distribution area map**: The map uses Azure Maps, which you can configure directly in Azure IoT Central. The map tile displays the device location. Hover over the map and try the controls over the map, like *zoom in*, *zoom out*, or *expand*.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/water-consumption-monitoring-dashboard-map.png" alt-text="Water consumption monitoring dashboard map":::

* **Average water flow line chart** and **Environmental condition line chart**: You can visualize one or multiple device telemetries plotted as a line chart over a desired time range.
* **Average valve pressure heatmap chart**: You can choose the heatmap visualization type of device telemetry data you want to see distributed over a time range with a color index.
* **Reset alert thresholds content tile**: You can include call-to-action content tiles and embed a link to an action page. In this case, the reset alert threshold takes you to the application **Jobs**, where you can run updates to device properties. You'll explore this option later in the [Configure jobs](../government/tutorial-water-consumption-monitoring.md#configure-jobs) section of this tutorial.
* **Property tiles**: The dashboard displays **Valve operational info**, **Flow alert thresholds**, and **Maintenance info** tiles.

### Customize the dashboard

You can customize views in the dashboard for operators.

1. Select **Edit** to customize the **Wide World water consumption dashboard**. You can customize the dashboard by selecting the **Edit** menu. After the dashboard is in **edit** mode, you can add new tiles or you can configure it.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/water-consumption-monitoring-edit-dashboard.png" alt-text="Edit dashboard":::

## Explore the device template

 In Azure IoT Central, a device template defines the capabilities of a device. Device capabilities include telemetry sent by device sensors, device properties, and commands the device can execute. You can define one or more device templates in Azure IoT Central that represent the capability of the devices that you'll connect.

The water consumption monitoring application comes with two reference device templates that represent a *flow meter* and a *smart valve* device.

To view the device template:

1. Select **Device templates** on the left pane of your application in Azure IoT Central. In the **Device templates** list, you'll see two device templates, **Smart Valve** and **Flow meter**.

   ![Device template](./media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/water-consumption-monitoring-device-template.png)

1. Select the **Flow meter** device template, and familiarize yourself with the device capabilities.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-waterconsumptionmonitoring/water-consumption-monitoring-high-flow-alert.png" alt-text="High pH alert":::

    The `High water flow alert` rule is configured to check against the condition `Flow` is `greater than` the `Max flow threshold`. Flow threshold is a cloud property defined in the **Smart Valve** device template. The value of `Max flow threshold` is set per device instance.

Next, you can create an email action.

To add an action to the rule:

1. Select **+ Email**.
1. Enter **High flow alert** as the friendly **Display name** for the action.
1. Enter the email address associated with your Azure IoT Central account in **To**.
1. Optionally, enter a note to include in the text of the email.
1. Select **Done** to complete the action.
1. Select **Save** to save the new rule.
1. Enable the rule.

Within a few minutes, you'll receive an email after the configured condition is met.

> [!NOTE]
> The application sends an email each time a condition is met. Select **Disable** to disable the rule to stop receiving email from the automated rule.
  
To create a new rule:

To create a new rule, select **+ New** on the **Rules** tab on the left pane.
