# View and edit Video Analyzer for Media insights

This topic shows you how to view and edit the Azure Video Analyzer for Media (formerly Video Indexer) insights of a video.

1. Browse to the [Video Analyzer for Media](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) website and sign in.
2. Find a video from which you want to create your Video Analyzer for Media insights. For more information, see [Find exact moments within videos](video-indexer-search.md).
3. Press **Play**.

	The page shows the video's summarized insights.

4. View the summarized insights of the video. 

	Summarized insights show an aggregated view of the data: faces, keywords, sentiments. For example, you can see the faces of people and the time ranges each face appears in and the % of the time it is shown.

	The player and the insights are synchronized. For example, if you click a keyword or the transcript line, the player brings you to that moment in the video. You can achieve the player/insights view and synchronization in your application. For more information, see [Embed Azure Indexer widgets into your application](video-indexer-embed-widgets.md).
