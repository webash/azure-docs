When you set up the Azure resources, a short video of highway traffic is copied to the Linux VM in Azure that you're using as the IoT Edge device. This quickstart uses the video file to simulate a live stream.

Open an application such as [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). Select Ctrl+N and then paste a link to [the highway intersection sample video](https://lvamedia.blob.core.windows.net/public/camera-300s.mkv) to start playback. You see the footage of many vehicles moving in highway traffic.
