A preview audience can access your offer prior to it being published live in the marketplace in order to test the end-to-end functionality before you publish it live. On the **Preview audience** page, you can define a limited preview audience.

> [!NOTE]
> A preview audience differs from a private plan. A private plan is one you make available only to a specific audience you choose. This enables you to negotiate a custom plan with specific customers. For more information, see the next section: Plans.

You can send invites to Microsoft Account (MSA) or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) email addresses. Add up to 10 email addresses manually or import up to 20 with a .csv file. If your offer is already live, you can still define a preview audience for testing any changes or updates to your offer.
