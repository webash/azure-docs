# Plan an IoT Edge modules offer

The [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-edge/) platform is backed by Microsoft Azure.  This platform enables users to deploy cloud workloads to run directly on IoT devices.  An IoT Edge module can run offline workloads and do data analysis locally. This offer type helps to save bandwidth, safeguard local and sensitive data, and offers low-latency response time.  You now have the options to take advantage of these pre-built workloads. Until now, only a handful of first-party solutions from Microsoft were available.  You had to invest the time and resources into building your own custom IoT solutions.

With [IoT Edge modules in the Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/category/internet-of-things?page=1), we now have a single destination for publishers to expose and sell their solutions to the IoT audience. IoT developers can ultimately find and purchase capabilities to accelerate their solution development.  

## Key benefits of IoT Edge modules in Azure Marketplace

| **For publishers**    | **For customers (IoT developers)**  |

| Monetize with flexible billing options <ul><li>Free and Bring Your Own License (BYOL).</li></ul> | Make purchases with your choice of billing models.<ul><li>Free and Bring Your Own License (BYOL).</li></ul> |

## What is an IoT Edge module?

Azure IoT Edge lets you deploy and manage business logic on the edge in the form of modules. Azure IoT Edge modules are the smallest computation units managed by IoT Edge, and can contain Microsoft services (such as Azure Stream Analytics), third-party services or your own solution-specific code. To learn more about IoT Edge modules, see [Understand Azure IoT Edge modules](../iot-edge/iot-edge-modules.md).

### What is the difference between a Container offer type and an IoT Edge module offer type?

The IoT Edge module offer type is a specific type of container running on an IoT Edge device. It comes with default configuration settings to run in the IoT Edge context, and optionally uses the IoT Edge module SDK to be integrated with the IoT Edge runtime.

## Select the right online store

IoT Edge Modules are only published to the Azure Marketplace; AppSource does not apply. For more information on the differences across online stores, see [Determine your publishing option](determine-your-listing-type.md).

## Technical Requirements

The primary technical requirements for an IoT Edge Module, in order for it to get certified and published in the Azure Marketplace, are detailed in the [Prepare your IoT Edge module technical assets](iot-edge-technical-asset.md).

## Eligibility prerequisites

All the terms of the Microsoft Azure Marketplace agreements and policies apply to IoT Edge module offers.  Additionally, there are prerequisites and technical requirements for IoT Edge modules.  

To publish an IoT Edge module to the Azure Marketplace, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- Access to the Partner Center. For more information, see [Create a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center](create-account.md).
- Host your IoT Edge module in an Azure Container Registry.
- Have your IoT Edge module metadata ready such as (non-exhaustive list):
    - A title
    - A description (in HTML format)
    - A logo image (in sizes of 48 x 48 (optional), 90 x 90 (optional), and from 216 x 216 to 350 x 350 px, all in PNG format)
    - A term of use and privacy policy
    - Default module configuration (route, twin desired properties, createOptions, environment variables)
    - Documentation
    - Support contacts

## Licensing options

These are the available licensing options for Azure Container offers:

| Licensing option | Transaction process |
| --- | --- |
| Free | List your offer to customers for free. |
| BYOL | The Bring Your Own Licensing option lets your customers bring existing software licenses to Azure.\* |
|

\* As the publisher, you support all aspects of the software license transaction, including (but not limited to) order, fulfillment, metering, billing, invoicing, payment, and collection.

## Publishing options

In all cases, IoT Edge modules should select the **Transact** publishing option.  See [choose a publishing option](determine-your-listing-type.md) for more details on publishing options.  

## Customer leads

When you're publishing an offer to the commercial marketplace with Partner Center, you'll want to connect it to your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. This lets you receive customer contact information as soon as someone expresses interest in or uses your product. Connecting to a CRM is required if you want to enable a test drive; otherwise, connecting to a CRM is optional. Partner Center supports Azure table, Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement, HTTPS endpoint, Marketo, and Salesforce.

## Legal contracts

To simplify the procurement process for customers and reduce legal complexity for software vendors, Microsoft offers a standard contract you can use for your offers in the commercial marketplace. When you offer your software under the standard contract, customers only need to read and accept it one time, and you don't have to create custom terms and conditions.

You can choose to provide your own terms and conditions, instead of the standard contract. Customers must accept these terms before they can try your offer.
