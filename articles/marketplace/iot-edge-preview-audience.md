# Set the preview audience for an IoT Edge Module offer

Select **Preview audience** to choose a limited preview audience for validating your offer before publishing it live to the broader marketplace audience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you view your offer in Preview, you must select **Go live** to publish your offer to the public.

## Select preview audience GUIDs

Specify your preview audience using at least one Azure subscription ID GUID, along with an optional description. You can find your Azure subscription ID on the Subscriptions page in the Azure portal. Neither of these fields can be seen by customers.

Add up to 10 GUIDs individually or up to 100 by uploading a CSV file. By adding these subscription IDs, you define who can preview your offer before it's published live. If your offer is already live, you can define a preview audience to test changes or updates to your offer.
