## Validation assets

Upload a [Customization Analysis Report (CAR)](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/dev-tools/customization-analysis-report) in this section. This report is generated by analyzing your customization and extension models, based on a predefined set of best practice rules.

This file must be in XLS or XLSX format. If you have more than one report, you can upload a ZIP file containing all of the reports.

## Does solution include localizations?

## Does solution enable translation(s)?
