# Set up Dynamics 365 for Business Central offer technical configuration

This page defines the technical details used to connect to your offer. This connection lets us provision your offer for the end customer if they choose to acquire it.

## Extension package file

Upload the extension package file (.app) file for your offer.

## Library extension package file

Required if your offer must be installed along with another extension that will not be published to the marketplace. If so upload its .app file here.

>[!NOTE]
>The dependency package file is no longer used. Upload a library extension package file instead.

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Co-sell with Microsoft**. For information on setting up co-sell with Microsoft (optional), see [Co-sell partner engagement](./co-sell-overview.md). If you're not setting up co-sell or you've finished, continue with **Next steps** below.
