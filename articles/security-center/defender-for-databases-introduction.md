# Introduction to Azure Defender for open-source relational databases

This Azure Defender plan brings threat protections for the following open-source relational databases:

- [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](../postgresql/index.yml)
- [Azure Database for MySQL](../mysql/index.yml)
- [Azure Database for MariaDB](../mariadb/index.yml)

Azure Defender detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases. The plan makes it simple to address potential threats to databases without the need to be a security expert or manage advanced security monitoring systems.

## What are the benefits of Azure Defender for open-source relational databases?

Azure Defender provides security alerts on anomalous activities so that you can detect potential threats and respond to them as they occur.

When you enable this plan, Azure Defender will provide alerts when it detects anomalous database access and query patterns as well as suspicious database activities.

These alerts appear in Azure Defender's security alerts page and include:

- details of the suspicious activity that triggered them
- the associated MITRE ATT&CK tactic
- recommended actions for how to investigate and mitigate the threat
- options for continuing your investigations with Azure Sentinel

## What kind of alerts does Azure Defender for open-source relational databases provide?

Threat intelligence enriched security alerts are triggered when there are:

- **Anomalous database access and query patterns** - For example, an abnormally high number of failed sign-in attempts with different credentials (a brute force attempt)
- **Suspicious database activities** - For example, a legitimate user accessing an SQL Server from a breached computer which communicated with a crypto-mining C&C server
- **Brute-force attacks** â€“ With the ability to separate simple brute force from brute force on a valid user or a successful brute force
