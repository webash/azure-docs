# Automate application deployments to Azure Spring Cloud

Continuous integration and continuous delivery tools let you quickly deploy updates to existing applications with minimal effort and risk. Azure DevOps helps you organize and control these key jobs. 

This article shows you how to use the [Azure Spring Cloud task for Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/deploy/azure-spring-cloud) to deploy applications.

## Create an Azure Resource Manager service connection

Read [this article](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure) to learn how to create an Azure Resource Manager service connection to your Azure DevOps project. Be sure to select the same subscription you are using for your Azure Spring Cloud service instance.

## Build and deploy apps

### Deploy artifacts

You can build and deploy your projects using a series of tasks. This snippet defines variables, a .NET Core task to build the application, and an Azure Spring Cloud task to deploy the application.

```yaml
variables:
  workingDirectory: './steeltoe-sample'
  planetMainEntry: 'Microsoft.Azure.SpringCloud.Sample.PlanetWeatherProvider.dll'
  solarMainEntry: 'Microsoft.Azure.SpringCloud.Sample.SolarSystemWeather.dll'
  planetAppName: 'planet-weather-provider'
  solarAppName: 'solar-system-weather'
  serviceName: '<your service name>'


steps:
# Restore, build, publish and package the zipped planet app
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'publish'
    publishWebProjects: false
    arguments: '--configuration Release'
    zipAfterPublish: false
    modifyOutputPath: false
    workingDirectory: $(workingDirectory)

# Deploy the planet app
- task: AzureSpringCloud@0
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<Service Connection Name>'
    Action: 'Deploy'
    AzureSpringCloud: $(serviceName)
    AppName: 'testapp'
    UseStagingDeployment: false
    DeploymentName: 'default'
    Package: $(workingDirectory)/src/$(planetAppName)/publish-deploy-planet.zip
    RuntimeVersion: 'NetCore_31'
    DotNetCoreMainEntryPath: $(planetMainEntry)

# Deploy the solar app
- task: AzureSpringCloud@0
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<Service Connection Name>'
    Action: 'Deploy'
    AzureSpringCloud: $(serviceName)
    AppName: 'testapp'
    UseStagingDeployment: false
    DeploymentName: 'default'
    Package: $(workingDirectory)/src/$(solarAppName)/publish-deploy-solar.zip
    RuntimeVersion: 'NetCore_31'
    DotNetCoreMainEntryPath: $(solarMainEntry)
```

### Deploy artifacts

#### To production

You can build and deploy your projects using a series of tasks. This snippet first defines a Maven task to build the application, followed by a second task that deploys the JAR file using the Azure Spring Cloud task for Azure Pipelines.

```yaml
steps:
- task: Maven@3
  inputs:
    mavenPomFile: 'pom.xml'
- task: AzureSpringCloud@0
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<your service connection name>'
    Action: 'Deploy'
    AzureSpringCloud: <your Azure Spring Cloud service>
    AppName: <app-name>
    UseStagingDeployment: false
    DeploymentName: 'default'
    Package: ./target/your-result-jar.jar
```

#### Blue-green deployments

The deployment shown in the previous section immediately receives application traffic upon deployment. Sometimes, developers want to test their applications in the production environment but before the application receives any customer traffic.

The following snippet builds the application the same way as above and then deploys it to a staging deployment. In this example, the staging deployment must already exist. For an alternative approach, see [Blue-green deployment strategies](concepts-blue-green-deployment-strategies.md).


```yaml
steps:
- task: Maven@3
  inputs:
    mavenPomFile: 'pom.xml'
- task: AzureSpringCloud@0
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<your service connection name>'
    Action: 'Deploy'
    AzureSpringCloud: <your Azure Spring Cloud service>
    AppName: <app-name>
    UseStagingDeployment: true
    Package: ./target/your-result-jar.jar
- task: AzureSpringCloud@0
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<your service connection name>'
    Action: 'Set Production'
    AzureSpringCloud: <your Azure Spring Cloud service>
    AppName: <app-name>
    UseStagingDeployment: true
```

### Deploy from source

It is possible to deploy directly to Azure without a separate build step.

```yaml
- task: AzureSpringCloud@0
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: '<your service connection name>'
    Action: 'Deploy'
    AzureSpringCloud: <your Azure Spring Cloud service>
    AppName: <app-name>
    UseStagingDeployment: false
    DeploymentName: 'default'
    Package: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)
```
