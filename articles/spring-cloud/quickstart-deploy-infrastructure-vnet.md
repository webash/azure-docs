# Quickstart: Provision Azure Spring Cloud using an ARM template

This quickstart describes how to use an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to deploy an Azure Spring Cloud cluster into an existing virtual network.

Azure Spring Cloud makes it easy to deploy Spring Boot microservice applications to Azure without any code changes. The service manages the infrastructure of Spring Cloud applications so developers can focus on their code. Azure Spring Cloud provides lifecycle management using comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics, configuration management, service discovery, CI/CD integration, blue-green deployments, and more.

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](../../includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, select the **Deploy to Azure** button. The template will open in the Azure portal.

[![Deploy to Azure](../media/template-deployments/deploy-to-azure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-spring-cloud-reference-architecture%2Fmain%2FARM%2Fbrownfield-deployment%2fazuredeploy.json)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* Two dedicated subnets for the Azure Spring Cloud Cluster, one for the service runtime and another for the Spring Boot micro-service applications. For subnet and virtual network requirements, see the [Virtual network requirements](how-to-deploy-in-azure-virtual-network.md#virtual-network-requirements) section of [Deploy Azure Spring Cloud in a virtual network](how-to-deploy-in-azure-virtual-network.md).
* An existing Log Analytics workspace for Azure Spring Cloud diagnostics settings and a workspace-based Application Insights resource. For more information, see [Analyze logs and metrics with diagnostics settings](diagnostic-services.md) and [Application Insights Java In-Process Agent in Azure Spring Cloud](how-to-application-insights.md).
* Three internal Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) ranges (at least */16* each) that you've identified for use by the Azure Spring Cloud cluster. These CIDR ranges will not be directly routable and will be used only internally by the Azure Spring Cloud Cluster. Clusters may not use *169.254.0.0/16*, *172.30.0.0/16*, *172.31.0.0/16*, or *192.0.2.0/24* for the internal Spring Cloud CIDR ranges, or any IP ranges included within the cluster virtual network address range.
* Service permission granted to the virtual network. The Azure Spring Cloud Resource Provider requires Owner permission to your virtual network in order to grant a dedicated and dynamic service principal on the virtual network for further deployment and maintenance. For instructions and more information, see the [Grant service permission to the virtual network](how-to-deploy-in-azure-virtual-network.md#grant-service-permission-to-the-virtual-network) section of [Deploy Azure Spring Cloud in a virtual network](how-to-deploy-in-azure-virtual-network.md).
* If you're using Azure Firewall or a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA), you'll also need to satisfy the following prerequisites:
   * Network and fully qualified domain name (FQDN) rules. For more information, see [Virtual network requirements](how-to-deploy-in-azure-virtual-network.md#virtual-network-requirements).
   * A unique User Defined Route (UDR) applied to each of the service runtime and Spring Boot micro-service application subnets. For more information about UDRs, see [Virtual network traffic routing](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md). The UDR should be configured with a route for *0.0.0.0/0* with a destination of your NVA before deploying the Spring Cloud cluster. For more information, see the [Bring your own route table](how-to-deploy-in-azure-virtual-network.md#bring-your-own-route-table) section of [Deploy Azure Spring Cloud in a virtual network](how-to-deploy-in-azure-virtual-network.md).

## Review the template

The template used in this quickstart is from [Azure Spring Cloud reference architecture](reference-architecture.md).

:::code language="json" source="~/azure-spring-cloud-reference-architecture/ARM/brownfield-deployment/azuredeploy.json":::

Two Azure resources are defined in the template:

* [Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring](/azure/templates/microsoft.appplatform/spring): Create an Azure Spring Cloud instance.
* [Microsoft.Insights/components](/azure/templates/microsoft.insights/components): Create an Application Insights workspace.

For Azure CLI and Terraform deployments, see the [Azure Spring Cloud Reference Architecture](https://github.com/Azure/azure-spring-cloud-reference-architecture) repository on GitHub.

## Deploy the template

To deploy the template, follow these steps:

1. Select the following image to sign in to Azure and open a template. The template creates an Azure Spring Cloud instance into an existing Virtual Network and a workspace-based Application Insights instance into an existing Azure Monitor Log Analytics Workspace.

   [![Deploy to Azure](../media/template-deployments/deploy-to-azure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-spring-cloud-reference-architecture%2Fmain%2FARM%2Fbrownfield-deployment%2fazuredeploy.json)

2. Enter Values for the following fields:

- **Resource Group:** select **Create new**, enter a unique name for the **resource group**, and then select **OK**.
- **springCloudInstanceName:** Enter the name of the Azure Spring Cloud resource.
- **appInsightsName:** Enter the name of the Application Insights instance for Azure Spring Cloud.
- **laWorkspaceResourceId:** Enter the resource ID of the existing Log Analytics workspace (for example, */subscriptions/<your subscription>/resourcegroups/<your log analytics resource group>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/<your log analytics workspace name>*.)
- **springCloudAppSubnetID:** Enter the resourceID of the Azure Spring Cloud App Subnet.
- **springCloudRuntimeSubnetID:** Enter the resourceID of the Azure Spring Cloud Runtime Subnet.
- **springCloudServiceCidrs:** Enter a comma-separated list of IP address ranges (3 in total) in CIDR format. The IP ranges are reserved to host underlying Azure Spring Cloud infrastructure. These 3 ranges should be at least */16* unused IP ranges, and must not overlap with any routable subnet IP ranges used within the network.
- **tags:** Enter any custom tags.

3. Select **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

## Review deployed resources

You can either use the Azure portal to check the deployed resources, or use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell script to list the deployed resources.

## Clean up resources

If you plan to continue working with subsequent quickstarts and tutorials, you might want to leave these resources in place. When no longer needed, delete the resource group, which deletes the resources in the resource group. To delete the resource group by using Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell, use the following commands:

# [CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Enter the Resource Group name:" &&
read resourceGroupName &&
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName &&
echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..."
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
$resourceGroupName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the Resource Group name"
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName
Write-Host "Press [ENTER] to continue..."
```
