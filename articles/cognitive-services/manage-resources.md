# Recover deleted Cognitive Services resources

This article provides instructions on how to recover a Cognitive Services resource that is already deleted. The article also provides instructions on how to purge a deleted resource.

> [!NOTE]
> The instructions in this article are applicable to both a multi-service resource and a single-service resource. A multi-service resource enables access to multiple cognitive services using a single key and endpoint. On the other hand, a single-service resource enables access to just that specific cognitive service for which the resource was created.

## Prerequisites

* The resource to be recovered must have been deleted within the past 48 hours.
* The resource to be recovered must not have been purged already. A purged resource cannot be recovered.
* Before you attempt to recover a deleted resource, make sure that the resource group for that account exists. If the resource group was deleted, you must recreate it. Recovering a resource group is not possible. For more information, seeâ€¯[Manage resource groups](../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md).
* If the deleted resource used customer-managed keys with Azure Key Vault and the key vault has also been deleted, then you must restore the key vault before you restore the Cognitive Services resource. For more information, see [Azure Key Vault recovery management](../key-vault/general/key-vault-recovery.md).
* If the deleted resource used a customer-managed storage and storage account has also been deleted, you must restore the storage account before you restore the Cognitive Services resource. For instructions, see [Recover a deleted storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-recover.md).

Your subscription must have `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/locations/resourceGroups/deletedAccounts/delete` permissions to purge resources, such as [Cognitive Services Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#cognitive-services-contributor) or [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor). 

## Recover a deleted resource 

To recover a deleted cognitive service resource, use the following commands. Where applicable, replace:

* `{subscriptionID}` with your Azure subscription ID
* `{resourceGroup}` with your resource group
* `{resourceName}` with your resource name
* `{location}` with the location of your resource

### Using the REST API

Use the following `PUT` command:

```rest-api
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{resourceName}?Api-Version=2021-04-30
```

In the request body, use the following JSON format:

```json
{ 
  "location": "{location}", 
   "properties": { 
        "restore": true 
    } 
} 
```

### Using PowerShell

Use the following command to restore the resource: 

```powershell
New-AzResource -Location {location}-Properties @{restore=$true} -ResourceId /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{resourceName}   -ApiVersion 2021-04-30 
```

If you need to find the name of your deleted resources, you can get a list of deleted resource names with the following command: 

```powershell
Get-AzResource -ResourceId /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/deletedAccounts -ApiVersion 2021-04-30 
```


## Purge a deleted resource 

Once you delete a resource, you won't be able to create another one with the same name for 48 hours. To create a resource with the same name, you will need to purge the deleted resource.

To purge a deleted cognitive service resource, use the following commands. Where applicable, replace:

* `{subscriptionID}` with your Azure subscription ID
* `{resourceGroup}` with your resource group
* `{resourceName}` with your resource name
* `{location}` with the location of your resource

> [!NOTE]
> Once a resource is purged, it is permanently deleted and cannot be restored. You will lose all data and keys associated with the resource.

### Using the REST API

Use the following `DELETE` command:

```rest-api
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/locations/{location}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/deletedAccounts/{resourceName}?Api-Version=2021-04-30`
```

### Using PowerShell

```powershell
Remove-AzResource -ResourceId /subscriptions/{subscriptionID}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/locations/{location}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/deletedAccounts/{resourceName}  -ApiVersion 2021-04-30`
```

### Using the Azure CLI

```azurecli-interactive
az resource delete /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/locations/{location}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/deletedAccounts/{resourceName}
```
