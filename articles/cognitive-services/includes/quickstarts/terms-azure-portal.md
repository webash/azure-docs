You must create your first Face, Text Analytics, or Computer Vision resources from the Azure portal to review and acknowledge the terms and conditions. You can do so here: [Face](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFace), [Text Analytics](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics), [Computer Vision](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision). After that, you can create subsequent resources using any deployment tool (SDK, CLI, or ARM template, etc) under the same Azure subscription.
