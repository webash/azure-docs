| <font size=5>Acumatica</font>| [**Acumatica**](https://www.acumatica.com/) is a technology provider that develops cloud- and browser-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) software for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). To bring expense claims into the modern age, Acumatica incorporated Form Recognizer, part of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, into its native application.

|<font size=5>Automation Anywhere</font>| [**Automation Anywhere**](https://www.automationanywhere.com/) is on a singular and unwavering mission to democratize automation and create a better future for everyone, liberating people from mundane, repetitive tasks, and allowing them more time to use their intellect and creativity with cloud-native robotic process automation (RPA)software. To protect the citizens of the United Kingdom, healthcare providers must process tens of thousands of COVID-19 tests daily, each one accompanied by a form for the World Health Organization (WHO). Manually completing and processing these forms would potentially slow testing and divert resources away from patient care. In response, Automation Anywhere built an AI-powered bot to help one healthcare provider automatically process and submit the COVID-19 test forms at scale. | [Customer story](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/811346-automation-anywhere-partner-professional-services-azure-cognitive-services) |
