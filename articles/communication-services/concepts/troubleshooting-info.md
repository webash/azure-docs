# Troubleshooting in Azure Communication Services

This document will help you troubleshoot issues that you may experience within your Communication Services solution. If you're troubleshooting SMS, you can [enable delivery reporting with Event Grid](../quickstarts/telephony-sms/handle-sms-events.md) to capture SMS delivery details.

## Getting help

We encourage developers to submit questions, suggest features, and report problems as issues. To aid in doing this we have a [dedicated support and help options page](../support.md) which lists your options for support.

To help you troubleshoot certain types of issues, you may be asked for any of the following pieces of information:

* **MS-CV ID**: This ID is used to troubleshoot calls and messages.
* **Call ID**: This ID is used to identify Communication Services calls.
* **SMS message ID**: This ID is used to identify SMS messages.
* **Call logs**: These logs contain detailed information that can be used to troubleshoot calling and network issues.


## Access your MS-CV ID

The MS-CV ID can be accessed by configuring diagnostics in the `clientOptions` object instance when initializing your SDKs. Diagnostics can be configured for any of the Azure SDKs including Chat, Identity, and VoIP calling.

### Client options example

The following code snippets demonstrate diagnostics configuration. When the SDKs are used with diagnostics enabled, diagnostics details will be emitted to the configured event listener:

# [C#](#tab/csharp)
```
// 1. Import Azure.Core.Diagnostics
using Azure.Core.Diagnostics;

// 2. Initialize an event source listener instance
using var listener = AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger();
Uri endpoint = new Uri("https://<RESOURCE-NAME>.communication.azure.net");
var (token, communicationUser) = await GetCommunicationUserAndToken();
CommunicationUserCredential communicationUserCredential = new CommunicationUserCredential(token);

// 3. Setup diagnostic settings
var clientOptions = new ChatClientOptions()
{
    Diagnostics =
    {
        LoggedHeaderNames = { "*" },
        LoggedQueryParameters = { "*" },
        IsLoggingContentEnabled = true,
    }
};

// 4. Initialize the ChatClient instance with the clientOptions
ChatClient chatClient = new ChatClient(endpoint, communicationUserCredential, clientOptions);
ChatThreadClient chatThreadClient = await chatClient.CreateChatThreadAsync("Thread Topic", new[] { new ChatThreadMember(communicationUser) });
```

# [Python](#tab/python)
```
from azure.communication.chat import ChatClient, CommunicationUserCredential
endpoint = "https://communication-services-sdk-live-tests-for-python.communication.azure.com"
chat_client = ChatClient(
    endpoint,
    CommunicationUserCredential(token),
    http_logging_policy=your_logging_policy)
```

## Access your call ID

When troubleshooting voice or video calls, you may be asked to provide a `call ID`. This can be accessed via the `id` property of the `call` object:

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)
```javascript
// `call` is an instance of a call created by `callAgent.startCall` or `callAgent.join` methods
console.log(call.id)
```

# [iOS](#tab/ios)
```objc
// The `call id` property can be retrieved by calling the `call.getCallId()` method on a call object after a call ends
// todo: the code snippet suggests it's a property while the comment suggests it's a method call
print(call.callId)
```

# [Android](#tab/android)
```java
// The `call id` property can be retrieved by calling the `call.getCallId()` method on a call object after a call ends
// `call` is an instance of a call created by `callAgent.startCall(…)` or `callAgent.join(…)` methods
Log.d(call.getCallId())
```
---

## Access your SMS message ID

For SMS issues, you can collect the message ID from the response object.

# [.NET](#tab/dotnet)
```
// Instantiate the SMS client
const smsClient = new SmsClient(connectionString);
async function main() {
  const result = await smsClient.send({
    from: "+18445792722",
    to: ["+1972xxxxxxx"],
    message: "Hello World 👋🏻 via Sms"
  }, {
    enableDeliveryReport: true // Optional parameter
  });
console.log(result); // your message ID will be in the result
}
```
---

## Enable and access call logs

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

The Azure Communication Services Calling SDK relies internally on [@azure/logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/logger) library to control logging.
Use the `setLogLevel` method from the `@azure/logger` package to configure the log output:

```javascript
import { setLogLevel } from '@azure/logger';
setLogLevel('verbose');
const callClient = new CallClient();
```

You can use AzureLogger to redirect the logging output from Azure SDKs by overriding the `AzureLogger.log` method:
This may be useful if you want to redirect logs to a location other than console.

```javascript
import { AzureLogger } from '@azure/logger';
// redirect log output
AzureLogger.log = (...args) => {
  console.log(...args); // to console, file, buffer, REST API..
};
```

# [iOS](#tab/ios)

When developing for iOS, your logs are stored in `.blog` files. Note that you can't view the logs directly because they're encrypted.

These can be accessed by opening Xcode. Go to Windows > Devices and Simulators > Devices. Select your device. Under Installed Apps, select your application and click on "Download container".

This will give you a `xcappdata` file. Right-click on this file and select “Show package contents”. You'll then see the `.blog` files that you can then attach to your Azure support request.

# [Android](#tab/android)

When developing for Android, your logs are stored in `.blog` files. Note that you can't view the logs directly because they're encrypted.

On Android Studio, navigate to the Device File Explorer by selecting View > Tool Windows > Device File Explorer from both the simulator and the device. The `.blog` file will be located within your application's directory, which should look something like `/data/data/[app_name_space:com.contoso.com.acsquickstartapp]/files/acs_sdk.blog`. You can attach this file to your support request.

## Enable and access call logs (Windows)

When developing for Windows, your logs are stored in `.blog` files. Note that you can't view the logs directly because they're encrypted.

These can be accessed by looking at where your app is keeping its local data. There are many ways to figure out where a UWP app keeps its local data, the following steps are just one of these ways:
1. Open a Windows Command Prompt (Windows Key + R)
2. Type `cmd.exe`
3. Type `where /r %USERPROFILE%\AppData acs*.blog`
4. Please check if the app ID of your application matches with the one returned by the previous command.
5. Open the folder with the logs by typing `start ` followed by the path returned by the step 3. For example: `start C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Local\Packages\e84000dd-df04-4bbc-bf22-64b8351a9cd9_k2q8b5fxpmbf6`
6. Please attach all the `*.blog` and `*.etl` files to your Azure support request.


## Calling SDK error codes

The Azure Communication Services Calling SDK uses the following error codes to help you troubleshoot calling issues. These error codes are exposed through the `call.callEndReason` property after a call ends.
