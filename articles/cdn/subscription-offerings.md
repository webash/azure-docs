# Azure CDN subscription offers and bandwidth throttling

Some Azure CDNs offerings are only available to certain subscription types. Bandwidth throttling may also apply depending on your subscription type.

## Free and Trial Subscription

Azure CDN from Microsoft is the only CDN offering that is available to trial subscriptions. Bandwidth throttling is applied for this type of subscription.  
 
## Pay-as-you-go

Azure CDN from Akamai is unavailable for Pay-as-you-go subscriptions.   
 
Bandwidth for Azure CDN from Microsoft and Verizon will be throttled until the subscription is determined to be in good standing and has a sufficient payment history. The process for determining the subscription status and having throttling removed happens automatically after the first payment has been received.   
 
If you have made a payment and throttling hasn't been removed, you can request to do so by [contacting support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade). 
  
## Enterprise agreements

All Azure CDNs are available to Enterprise Agreement subscriptions. Enterprise Agreements subscriptions don't have any bandwidth restrictions.  
 
## Other offer types
 
The same functionality as Pay-as-you-go applies to these types of agreements:

* Visual Studio 
* MSDN
* Students
* CSP
