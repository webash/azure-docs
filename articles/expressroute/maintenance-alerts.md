# How to view and configure alerts for Azure ExpressRoute circuit maintenance

With Service Health, you can view planned and past maintenance in the Azure portal along with configuring alerts and notifications that best suits your needs. To learn more about Azure Service Health refer to [What is Azure Service Health?](../service-health/overview.md)

## View planned maintenance
