# MySQL on-premises to Azure Database for MySQL migration guide Summary

## Prerequisites

[Security](13-security.md)

## Overview

This document has covered several topics related to migrating an application from on-premises MySQL to Azure Database for MySQL. We covered how to begin and assess the project all the way to application cut over.

The migration team needs to review the topics carefully as the choices made can have project timeline effects. The total cost of ownership is enticing given the many enterprise ready features provided.

The migration project approach is important. The team needs to assess the application and database complexity to determine the amount of conversion time. Conversion tools help make the transition easier, but there have always been an element of manual review and updates required. Scripting out pre-migration tasks and post migration testing is important.

Application architecture and design can provide strong indicators as to the level of effort required. For example, applications utilizing ORM frameworks can be great candidates, especially if the business logic is contained in the application instead of database objects.

In the end, several tools exist in the marketplace ranging from free to commercial. This document covered the steps required if the team plans a database migration using one of the more popular open-source tool options. Whichever path that is chosen, Microsoft and the MySQL community have the tools and expertise to make the database migration successful.
