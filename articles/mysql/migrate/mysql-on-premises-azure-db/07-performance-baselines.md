# MySQL on-premises to Azure Database for MySQL migration guide Performance Baselines

## Prerequisites

[Test plans](06-test-plans.md)

## Overview

Understanding the existing MySQL workload is one of the best investments that can be made to ensure a successful migration. Excellent system performance depends on adequate hardware and great application design. Items such as CPU, memory, disk, and networking need to be sized and configured appropriately for the anticipated load. Hardware and configuration are part of the system performance equation. The developer must understand the database query load and the most expensive queries to execute. Focusing on the most expensive queries can make a substantial difference in the overall performance metrics.

Creating baselines of query performance is vital to a migration project. The performance baselines can be used to verify the Azure landing zone configuration for the migrated data workloads. Most systems will be run 24/7 and have different peak load times. It's important to capture the peak workloads for the baseline. Metrics are captured several times. Later in the document, we explore the source server parameters and how they're essential to the overall performance baseline picture. The server parameters should not be overlooked during a migration project.

## Tools

Below are tools used to gather server metrics and database workload information. Use the captured metrics to determine the appropriate Azure Database for MySQL tier and the associated scaling options.

  - [MySQL Enterprise Monitor:](https://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/monitor.html) This non-free, enterprise edition tool can provide a sorted list of the most expensive queries, server metrics, file I/O and topology information

  - [Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management) : a best-of-breed open-source database monitoring solution. It helps to reduce complexity, optimize performance, and improve the security of business-critical database environments, no matter the deployed location.

## Server parameters

MySQL server default configurations may not adequately support a workload. There is a plethora of server parameters in MySQL, but in most cases the migration team should focus on a handful. The following parameters should be evaluated in the **source** and **target** environments. Incorrect configurations can affect the speed of the migration. We will revisit these parameters again when we execute the migration steps.

  - **innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size**: A large value will ensure in-memory resources are used first before utilizing disk I/O. Typical values will range from 80-90% of the available memory. For example, a system with 8GB of memory should allocate 5-6GB for the pool size.

  - **innodb\_log\_file\_size**: The redo logs are used to ensure fast durable writes. This transactional backup is helpful during a system crash. Starting with innodb\_log\_file\_size = 512M (giving 1GB of redo logs) should give plenty of room for writes. Write-intensive applications using MySQL 5.6 or higher should start with innodb\_log\_file\_size = 4G.

  - **max\_connections**: This parameter can help alleviate the `Too many connections` error. The default is 151 connections. Using a connection pool at the application level is preferred, but the server connection configuration may need to increase as well.

  - **innodb\_file\_per\_table**: This setting will tell InnoDB if it should store data and indexes in the shared tablespace or in a separate.ibd file for each table. Having a file per table enables the server to reclaim space when tables are dropped, truncated, or rebuilt. Databases containing a large number of tables should not use the table per file configuration. As of MySQL 5.6, the default value is ON. Earlier database versions should set the configuration to ON prior to loading data. This setting only affects newly created tables.

  - **innodb\_flush\_log\_at\_trx\_commit**: The default setting of 1 means that InnoDB is fully ACID-compliant. This lower risk transaction configuration can have a significant overhead on systems with slow disks because of the extra fsyncs are needed to flush each change to the redo logs. Setting the parameter to 2 is a bit less reliable because committed transactions will be flushed to the redo logs only once a second. The risk can be acceptable in some master situations, and It's definitely a good value for a replica. A value of 0 allows for better system performance, but the database server is more likely to lose some data during a failure. The bottom line, use the 0 value for a replica only.

  - **innodb\_flush\_method**: This setting controls how data and logs are flushed to disk. Use `O_DIRECT` when in presence of a hardware RAID controller with a battery-protected write-back cache. Use `fdatasync` (default value) for other scenarios.

  - **innodb\_log\_buffer\_size**: This setting is the size of the buffer for transactions that have not been committed yet. The default value (1MB) is usually fine. Transactions with large blob/text fields can fill up the buffer quickly and trigger extra I/O load. Look at the `Innodb_log_waits` status variable and if It's not 0, increase `innodb_log_buffer_size`.

  - **query\_cache\_size**: The query cache is a well-known bottleneck that can be seen during moderate concurrency. The initial value should be set to 0 to disable cache. e.g. `query_cache_size = 0`. This is the default on MySQL 5.6 and later.

  - **log\_bin**: This setting will enable binary logging. Enabling binary logging is mandatory if the server is to act as a replication master.

  - **server\_id**: This setting will be a unique value to identity servers in replication topologies.

  - **expire\_logs\_days**: This setting will control how many days the binary logs will be automatically purged.

  - **skip\_name\_resolve**: user to perform client hostname resolution. If the DNS is slow, the connection will be slow. When disabling name resolution, the GRANT statements must use IP addresses only. Any GRANT statements made previously would need to be redone to use the IP.

Run the following command to export the server parameters to a file for review. Using some simple parsing, the output can be used to reapply the same server parameters after the migration, if appropriate to the Azure Database for MySQL server. Reference [Configure server parameters in Azure Database for MySQL using the Azure portal](../../howto-server-parameters.md).

`mysql -u root -p -A -e "SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES;" > settings.txt`

The MySQL 5.5.60 default installed server parameters can be found in the [appendix](15-appendix.md#default-server-parameters-mysql-55-and-azure-database-for-mysql).

Before migration begins, export the source MySQL configuration settings. Compare those values to the Azure landing zone instance settings after the migration. If any settings were modified from the default in the target Azure landing zone instance, ensure that these are set back after the migration. Also, the migration user should verify the server parameters can be set before the migration.

For a list of server parameters that cannot be configured, reference [Non-configurable server parameters](../../concepts-server-parameters.md#non-configurable-server-parameters).

### Egress and Ingress

For each respective data migration tool and path, the source and the target MySQL server parameters will need to be modified to support the fastest possible egress and ingress. Depending on the tool, the parameters could be different. For example, a tool that performs a migration in parallel may need more connections on the source and the target versus a single threaded tool.

Review any timeout parameters that may be affected by the datasets. These include:

  - [connect\_timeout](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_connect_timeout)

  - [wait\_timeout](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_wait_timeout)

Additionally, review any parameters that will affect maximums:

  - [max\_allowed\_packet](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet)

> [!NOTE]
> A common migration error is `MySQL server has gone away`. The parameters mentioned here are the typical culprits for resolving this error.

## WWI scenario

WWI reviewed their Conference database workload and determined it had a very small load. Although a basic tier server would work for them, they did not want to perform work later to migrate to another tier. The server being deployed will eventually host the other MySQL data workloads and so they picked the `General Performance` tier.

In reviewing the MySQL database, the MySQL 5.5 server is running with the defaults server parameters that are set during the initial install.
