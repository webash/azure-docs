# What's new in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server?

[Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](./overview.md#azure-database-for-mysql---flexible-server-preview) is a deployment mode that's designed to provide more granular control and flexibility over database management functions and configuration settings than does the Single Server deployment mode. The service currently supports community version of MySQL 5.7 and 8.0.

This article summarizes new releases and features in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server beginning in January 2021. Listings appear in reverse chronological order, with the most recent updates first.

## June 2021

This release of Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server includes the following updates.

-	**Improved performance on smaller storage servers**

    Beginning June 21, 2021, the minimum allowed provisioned storage size for all  newly created server increases from 5 GB to 20 GB. In addition, the available free IOPS increases from 100 to 300. These changes are summarized in the following table:

    | **Current** | **As of June 21, 2021** |
    |:----------|:----------|
    | Minimum allowed storage size: 5 GB | Minimum allowed storage size: 20 GB |
    | IOPS available: Max(100, 3 * [Storage provisioned in GB]) | IOPS available: (300 + 3 * [Storage provisioned in GB]) |

- **Free 12-month offer**

  Beginning June 15, 2021, new Azure users can take advantage of our 12-month [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/), which provides up to 750 hours of Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server and 32 GB of storage per month. Customers can take advantage of this offer to develop and deploy applications that use Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server (Preview).

- **Storage auto-grow**

  Storage auto-grow prevents a server from running out of storage and becoming read-only. If storage auto grow is enabled, the storage automatically grows without impacting the workload. Beginning June 21, 2021, all newly created servers will have storage auto-grow enabled by default. [Learn more](concepts-compute-storage.md#storage-auto-grow).

-	**Data-in Replication**

    Flexible Server now supports [Data-in Replication](concepts-data-in-replication.md). Use this feature to synchronize and migrate data from a MySQL server running on-premises, in virtual machines, on Azure Database for MySQL Single Server, or on database services outside Azure to Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server. Learn more about [How to configure Data-in Replication](how-to-data-in-replication.md).

- **GitHub actions support with Azure CLI**

  Flexible Server CLI now allows you to automate your workflow to deploy updates with GitHub actions.  Use this feature to help you set up and deploy your database updates with MySQL github action workflow. These CLI commands help you with setting up the repository to enable the continuous deployment for ease of development. [Learn more](/cli/azure/mysql/flexible-server/deploy?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true).

- **Zone redundant HA forced failover fixes**

  This release includes fixes for known issues related to forced failover to ensure that server parameters and additional IOPS changes are persisted across failovers.

- **Known issue**

  If a client application trying to connect to an instance of Flexible Server is in a peered virtual network (VNet), the application may not be able to connect using the Flexible Server *servername* because it cannot resolve the DNS name for the Flexible Server instance from a peered VNet. [Learn more](concepts-networking.md#connecting-from-peered-vnets-in-same-azure-region).

## May 2021

This release of Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server includes the following updates.

-	**Extended regional availability (France Central, Brazil South, and Switzerland North)**
