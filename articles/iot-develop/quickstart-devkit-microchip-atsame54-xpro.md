# Quickstart: Connect a Microchip ATSAME54-XPro Evaluation kit to IoT Central

**Applies to**: [Embedded device development](about-iot-develop.md#embedded-device-development)<br>
**Total completion time**:  45 minutes

[![Browse code](media/common/browse-code.svg)](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/tree/master/Microchip/ATSAME54-XPRO)

In this quickstart, you use Azure RTOS to connect the Microchip ATSAME54-XPro (hereafter, the Microchip E54) to Azure IoT.

You will complete the following tasks:

* Install a set of embedded development tools for programming a Microchip E54 in C
* Build an image and flash it onto the Microchip E54
* Use Azure IoT Central to create cloud components, view properties, view device telemetry, and call direct commands

## Prerequisites

* A PC running Microsoft Windows 10
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository
* Hardware

    * The [Microchip ATSAME54-XPro](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails/atsame54-xpro) (Microchip E54)
    * USB 2.0 A male to Micro USB male cable
    * Wired Ethernet access
    * Ethernet cable
    * Optional: [Weather Click](https://www.mikroe.com/weather-click) sensor. You can add this sensor to the device to monitor weather conditions. If you don't have this sensor, you can still complete this quickstart.
    * Optional: [mikroBUS Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO) adapter. Use this adapter to attach the Weather Click sensor to the Microchip E54. If you don't have the sensor and this adapter, you can still complete this quickstart.

## Prepare the development environment

To set up your development environment, first you clone a GitHub repo that contains all the assets you need for the quickstart. Then you install a set of programming tools.

### Clone the repo for the quickstart

Clone the following repo to download all sample device code, setup scripts, and offline versions of the documentation. If you previously cloned this repo in another quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

To clone the repo, run the following command:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started.git
```

### Install the tools

The cloned repo contains a setup script that installs and configures the required tools. If you installed these tools in another embedded device quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup script installs the following tools:
> * [CMake](https://cmake.org): Build
> * [ARM GCC](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm): Compile
> * [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm): Monitor serial port output for connected devices

To install the tools:

1. From File Explorer, navigate to the following path in the repo and run the setup script named *get-toolchain.bat*:

    *getting-started\tools\get-toolchain.bat*

1. After the installation, open a new console window to recognize the configuration changes made by the setup script. Use this console to complete the remaining programming tasks in the quickstart. You can use Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Git Bash for Windows.
1. Run the following code to confirm that CMake version 3.14 or later is installed.

    ```shell
    cmake --version
    ```
To install the remaining tools:

* Install [Microchip Studio for AVR&reg; and SAM devices](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/microchip-studio-for-avr-and-sam-devices#). Microchip Studio is a device development environment that includes the tools to program and flash the Microchip E54. For this tutorial, you use Microchip Studio only to flash the Microchip E54. The installation takes several minutes, and prompts you several times to approve the installation of components.

[!INCLUDE [iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device](../../includes/iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device.md)]

## Prepare the device

To connect the Microchip E54 to Azure, you'll modify a configuration file for Azure IoT settings, rebuild the image, and flash the image to the device.

### Add configuration

1. Open the following file in a text editor:

    *getting-started\Microchip\ATSAME54-XPRO\app\azure_config.h*

1. Set the Azure IoT device information constants to the values that you saved after you created Azure resources.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`IOT_DPS_ID_SCOPE` |{*Your ID scope value*}|
    |`IOT_DPS_REGISTRATION_ID` |{*Your Device ID value*}|
    |`IOT_DEVICE_SAS_KEY` |{*Your Primary key value*}|

1. Save and close the file.

### Connect the device

1. On the Microchip E54, locate the **Reset** button, the **Ethernet** port, and the Micro USB port, which is labeled **Debug USB**.

1. Connect the Micro USB cable to the **Debug USB** port on the Microchip E54, and then connect it to your computer.
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Optionally, for more information about setting up and getting started with the Microchip E54, see [SAM E54 Xplained Pro User's Guide](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/70005321A.pdf).

1. Use the Ethernet cable to connect the Microchip E54 to an Ethernet port.

### Optional: Install a weather sensor

If you have the Weather Click sensor and the mikroBUS Xplained Pro adapter, follow the steps in this section; otherwise, skip to [Build the image](#build-the-image). You can complete this quickstart even if you don't have a sensor. The sample code for the device returns simulated data if a real sensor is not present.

1. If you have the Weather Click sensor and the mikroBUS Xplained Pro adapter, install them on the Microchip E54.
1. Reopen the configuration file you edited previously:

    *getting-started\Microchip\ATSAME54-XPRO\app\azure_config.h*

1. Set the value of the constant `__SENSOR_BME280__` to *1* as shown in the following code from the header file. Setting this value enables the device to use real sensor data from the Weather Click sensor.

    `#define __SENSOR_BME280__ 1`

1. Save and close the file.

### Build the image

1. In your console or in File Explorer, run the script *rebuild.bat* at the following path to build the image:

    *getting-started\Microchip\ATSAME54-XPRO\tools\rebuild.bat*

2. After the build completes, confirm that the binary file was created in the following path:

    *getting-started\Microchip\ATSAME54-XPRO\build\app\atsame54_azure_iot.bin*

### Flash the image

1. Open the **Windows Start > Microchip Studio Command Prompt** console and go to the folder of the Microchip E54 binary file that you built.

    *getting-started\Microchip\ATSAME54-XPRO\build\app*

1. Use the *atprogram* utility to flash the Microchip E54 with the binary image:

    > [!NOTE] 
    > For more information about using the Atmel-ICE and atprogram tools with the Microchip E54, see [Using Atmel-ICE for AVR Programming In Mass Production](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/00002466A.pdf).

    ```shell
    atprogram --tool edbg --interface SWD --device ATSAME54P20A program --chiperase --file atsame54_azure_iot.bin --verify
    ```

    After the flashing process completes, the console confirms that programming was successful:

    ```output
    Firmware check OK
    Programming and verification completed successfully.
    ```

### Confirm device connection details
