# Quickstart: Connect a Renesas Starter Kit+ for RX65N-2MB to IoT Central

**Applies to**: [Embedded device development](about-iot-develop.md#embedded-device-development)<br>
**Total completion time**:  30 minutes

[![Browse code](media/common/browse-code.svg)](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/tree/master/Renesas/RSK_RX65N_2MB)

In this quickstart, you use Azure RTOS to connect the Renesas Starter Kit+ for RX65N-2MB (hereafter, the Renesas RX65N) to Azure IoT.

You will complete the following tasks:

* Install a set of embedded development tools for programming a Renesas RX65N in C
* Build an image and flash it onto the Renesas RX65N
* Use Azure IoT Central to create cloud components, view properties, view device telemetry, and call direct commands

## Prerequisites

* A PC running Microsoft Windows 10
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository
* Hardware

    * The [Renesas Starter Kit+ for RX65N-2MB](https://www.renesas.com/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/rx-32-bit-performance-efficiency-mcus/rx65n-2mb-starter-kit-plus-renesas-starter-kit-rx65n-2mb) (Renesas RX65N)
    * The [Renesas E2 emulator Lite](https://www.renesas.com/software-tool/e2-emulator-lite-rte0t0002lkce00000r)
    * 2 USB 2.0 A male to Mini USB male cables
    * The included 5V power supply
    * Ethernet cable
    * Wired Ethernet access

## Prepare the development environment

To set up your development environment, first you clone a GitHub repo that contains all the assets you need for the quickstart. Then you install a set of programming tools.

### Clone the repo for the quickstart

Clone the following repo to download all sample device code, setup scripts, and offline versions of the documentation. If you previously cloned this repo in another quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

To clone the repo, run the following command:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started.git
```

### Install the tools

The cloned repo contains a setup script that installs and configures the required tools. If you installed these tools in another embedded device quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup script installs the following tools:
> * [CMake](https://cmake.org): Build
> * [RX GCC](http://gcc-renesas.com/downloads/get.php?f=rx/8.3.0.202004-gnurx/gcc-8.3.0.202004-GNURX-ELF.exe): Compile
> * [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm): Monitor serial port output for connected devices

To install the tools:

1. From File Explorer, navigate to the following path in the repo and run the setup script named *get-toolchain.bat*:

    *getting-started\tools\get-toolchain.bat*

1. Add the RX compiler to the Windows Path:

    *%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\GCC for Renesas RX 8.3.0.202004-GNURX-ELF\rx-elf\rx-elf\bin*

1. After the installation, open a new console window to recognize the configuration changes made by the setup script. Use this console to complete the remaining programming tasks in the quickstart. You can use Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Git Bash for Windows.
1. Run the following commands to confirm that CMake version 3.14 or later is installed and the RX compiler path is set up correctly.

    ```shell
    cmake --version
    rx-elf-gcc
    ```
To install the remaining tools:

* Install [Renesas Flash Programmer](https://www.renesas.com/software-tool/renesas-flash-programmer-programming-gui). The Renesas Flash Programmer contains the drivers and tools needed to flash the Renesas RX65N via the Renesas E2 Lite.

[!INCLUDE [iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device](../../includes/iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device.md)]

## Prepare the device

To connect the Renesas RX65N to Azure, you'll modify a configuration file for Wi-Fi and Azure IoT settings, rebuild the image, and flash the image to the device.

### Add configuration

1. Open the following file in a text editor:

    *getting-started\Renesas\RSK_RX65N_2MB\app\azure_config.h*

1. Set the Azure IoT device information constants to the values that you saved after you created Azure resources.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`IOT_DPS_ID_SCOPE` |{*Your ID scope value*}|
    |`IOT_DPS_REGISTRATION_ID` |{*Your Device ID value*}|
    |`IOT_DEVICE_SAS_KEY` |{*Your Primary key value*}|

1. Save and close the file.

### Build the image

1. In your console or in File Explorer, run the script *rebuild.bat* at the following path to build the image:

    *getting-started\Renesas\RSK_RX65N_2MB\tools\rebuild.bat*

2. After the build completes, confirm that the binary file was created in the following path:

    *getting-started\Renesas\RSK_RX65N_2MB\build\app\rx65n_azure_iot.hex*

### Connect the device

> [!NOTE]

### Confirm device connection details

You can use the **Termite** app to monitor communication and confirm that your device is set up correctly.
> [!TIP]
> If you have issues getting your device to initialize or connect after flashing, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-embedded-device-quickstarts.md).

1. Start **Termite**.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. In the **Serial port settings** dialog, check the following settings and update if needed:
    * **Baud rate**: 115,200
    * **Port**: The port that your Renesas RX65N is connected to. If there are multiple port options in the dropdown, you can find the correct port to use. Open Windows **Device Manager**, and view **Ports** to identify which port to use.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-renesas-rx65n-2mb/termite-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of serial port settings in the Termite app":::

1. Select OK.
1. Press the **Reset** button on the device.
1. In the **Termite** app, check the following checkpoint values to confirm that the device is initialized and connected to Azure IoT.

    ```output

    ```

Keep Termite open to monitor device output in the following steps.

## Verify the device status

To view the device status in IoT Central portal:
1. From the application dashboard, select **Devices** on the side navigation menu.
1. Confirm that the **Device status** is updated to **Provisioned**.
1. Confirm that the **Device template** is updated to **Getting Started Guide**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-renesas-rx65n-2mb/iot-central-device-view-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot of device status in IoT Central":::

## View telemetry

With IoT Central, you can view the flow of telemetry from your device to the cloud.

To view telemetry in IoT Central portal:

1. From the application dashboard, select **Devices** on the side navigation menu.
1. Select the device from the device list.
1. View the telemetry as the device sends messages to the cloud in the **Overview** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-renesas-rx65n-2mb/iot-central-device-telemetry.png" alt-text="Screenshot of device telemetry in IoT Central":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also monitor telemetry from the device by using the Termite app.

## Call a direct method on the device

You can also use IoT Central to call a direct method that you've implemented on your device. Direct methods have a name, and can optionally have a JSON payload, configurable connection, and method timeout. In this section, you call a method that enables you to turn an LED on or off.

To call a method in IoT Central portal:

1. Select the **Command** tab from the device page.
1. In the **State** dropdown, select **True**, and then select **Run**.  The LED light should turn on.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-renesas-rx65n-2mb/iot-central-invoke-method.png" alt-text="Screenshot of calling a direct method on a device in IoT Central":::

1. In the **State** dropdown, select **False**, and then select **Run**. The LED light should turn off.

## View device information

You can view the device information from IoT Central.

Select **About** tab from the device page.

:::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-renesas-rx65n-2mb/iot-central-device-about.png" alt-text="Screenshot of device information in IoT Central":::

## Troubleshoot

If you experience issues building the device code, flashing the device, or connecting, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-embedded-device-quickstarts.md).

## Clean up resources

If you no longer need the Azure resources created in this quickstart, you can delete them from the IoT Central portal.

To remove the entire Azure IoT Central sample application and all its devices and resources:
1. Select **Administration** > **Your application**.
1. Select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you built a custom image that contains Azure RTOS sample code, and then flashed the image to the Renesas RX65N device. You also used the IoT Central portal to create Azure resources, connect the Renesas RX65N securely to Azure, view telemetry, and send messages.
