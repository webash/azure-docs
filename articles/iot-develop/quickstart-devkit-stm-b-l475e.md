# Quickstart: Connect an ST Microelectronics B-L475E-IOT01A or B-L4S5I-IOT01A Discovery kit to IoT Central

**Applies to**: [Embedded device development](about-iot-develop.md#embedded-device-development)<br>
**Total completion time**:  30 minutes

[![Browse code](media/common/browse-code.svg)](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/tree/master/STMicroelectronics/STM32L4_L4+)

In this quickstart, you use Azure RTOS to connect either the ST Microelectronics [B-L475E-IOT01A](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html) or [B-L4S5I-IOT01A](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l4s5i-iot01a.html) Discovery kit (hereafter, the STM DevKit) to Azure IoT.

You will complete the following tasks:

* Install a set of embedded development tools for programming the STM DevKit in C
* Build an image and flash it onto the STM DevKit
* Use Azure IoT Central to create cloud components, view properties, view device telemetry, and call direct commands

## Prerequisites

* A PC running Microsoft Windows 10
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository
* Hardware

    * Either the [B-L475E-IOT01A](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html) or the [B-L4S5I-IOT01A](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l4s5i-iot01a.html) (STM DevKit)
    * Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz
    * USB 2.0 A male to Micro USB male cable

## Prepare the development environment

To set up your development environment, first you clone a GitHub repo that contains all the assets you need for the quickstart. Then you install a set of programming tools.

### Clone the repo for the quickstart

Clone the following repo to download all sample device code, setup scripts, and offline versions of the documentation. If you previously cloned this repo in another quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

To clone the repo, run the following command:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started.git
```

### Install the tools

The cloned repo contains a setup script that installs and configures the required tools. If you installed these tools in another embedded device quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup script installs the following tools:
> * [CMake](https://cmake.org): Build
> * [ARM GCC](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm): Compile
> * [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm): Monitor serial port output for connected devices

To install the tools:

1. From File Explorer, navigate to the following path in the repo and run the setup script named *get-toolchain.bat*:

    *getting-started\tools\get-toolchain.bat*

1. After the installation, open a new console window to recognize the configuration changes made by the setup script. Use this console to complete the remaining programming tasks in the quickstart. You can use Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Git Bash for Windows.
1. Run the following code to confirm that CMake version 3.14 or later is installed.

    ```shell
    cmake --version
    ```
[!INCLUDE [iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device](../../includes/iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device.md)]

## Prepare the device

To connect the STM DevKit to Azure, you'll modify a configuration file for Wi-Fi and Azure IoT settings, rebuild the image, and flash the image to the device.

### Add configuration

1. Open the following file in a text editor:

    *getting-started\STMicroelectronics\STM32L4_L4+\app\azure_config.h*

1. Set the Wi-Fi constants to the following values from your local environment.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`WIFI_SSID` |{*Your Wi-Fi SSID*}|
    |`WIFI_PASSWORD` |{*Your Wi-Fi password*}|
    |`WIFI_MODE` |{*One of the enumerated Wi-Fi mode values in the file*}|

1. Set the Azure IoT device information constants to the values that you saved after you created Azure resources.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`IOT_DPS_ID_SCOPE` |{*Your ID scope value*}|
    |`IOT_DPS_REGISTRATION_ID` |{*Your Device ID value*}|
    |`IOT_DEVICE_SAS_KEY` |{*Your Primary key value*}|

1. Save and close the file.

### Build the image

1. In your console or in File Explorer, run the script *rebuild.bat* at the following path to build the image:

    *getting-started\STMicroelectronics\STM32L4_L4+\tools\rebuild.bat*

2. After the build completes, confirm that two binary files were created. There's a binary image for each STM Devkit. The build saves the images to the following paths:

    *getting-started\STMicroelectronics\STM32L4_L4+\build\app\stm32l475_azure_iot.bin*

    *getting-started\STMicroelectronics\STM32L4_L4+\build\app\stm32l4S5_azure_iot.bin*

### Flash the image

1. On the STM DevKit MCU, locate the **Reset** button, the Micro USB port, which is labeled **USB STLink**, and the board part number. You will refer to these items in the next steps. All of them are highlighted in the following picture:

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-devkit-stm-b-l475e/stm-devkit-board.png" alt-text="Locate key components on the STM DevKit board":::

1. Connect the Micro USB cable to the **USB STLINK** port on the STM DevKit, and then connect it to your computer.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For detailed setup information about the STM DevKit, see the instructions on the packaging, or see [B-L475E-IOT01A Resources](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html#resource) or [B-L4S5I-IOT01A Resources](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l4s5i-iot01a.html#resource).

1. In File Explorer, find the binary files that you created in the previous section.

1. Copy the binary file whose file name corresponds to the part number of the STM Devkit you're using. For example, if your board part number is **B-L475E-IOT01A1**, copy the binary file named *stm32l475_azure_iot.bin*.

1. In File Explorer, find the STM Devkit that's connected to your computer. The device appears as a drive on your system with the drive label **DIS_L4IOT**.

1. Paste the binary file into the root folder of the STM Devkit. Flashing starts automatically and completes in a few seconds.

    > [!NOTE]
    > During the flashing process, a LED toggles between red and green on the STM DevKit.

### Confirm device connection details

You can use the **Termite** app to monitor communication and confirm that your device is set up correctly.

1. Start **Termite**.
    > [!TIP]
    > If you are unable to connect Termite to your devkit, install the [ST-LINK driver](https://my.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/software/driver/files/stsw-link009.zip) and try again. See  [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-embedded-device-quickstarts.md) for additional steps.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. In the **Serial port settings** dialog, check the following settings and update if needed:
    * **Baud rate**: 115,200
    * **Port**: The port that your STM DevKit is connected to. If there are multiple port options in the dropdown, you can find the correct port to use. Open Windows **Device Manager**, and view **Ports** to identify which port to use.
