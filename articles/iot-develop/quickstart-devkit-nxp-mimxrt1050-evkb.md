[![Browse code](media/common/browse-code.svg)](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/tree/master/NXP/MIMXRT1050-EVKB/)

In this quickstart, you use Azure RTOS to connect an NXP MIMXRT1050-EVKB Evaluation kit (hereafter, NXP EVK) to Azure IoT.

You will complete the following tasks:

* Install a set of embedded development tools for programming an NXP EVK in C
* Build an image and flash it onto the NXP EVK
* Use Azure IoT Central to create cloud components, view properties, view device telemetry, and call direct commands

## Prerequisites

* A PC running Microsoft Windows 10
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository
* Hardware

    * The [NXP MIMXRT1050-EVKB](https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/i-mx-rt1050-evaluation-kit:MIMXRT1050-EVK) (NXP EVK)
    * USB 2.0 A male to Micro USB male cable
    * Wired Ethernet access
    * Ethernet cable

## Prepare the development environment

To set up your development environment, first you clone a GitHub repo that contains all the assets you need for the quickstart. Then you install a set of programming tools.

### Clone the repo for the quickstart

Clone the following repo to download all sample device code, setup scripts, and offline versions of the documentation. If you previously cloned this repo in another quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

To clone the repo, run the following command:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started.git
```

### Install the tools

The cloned repo contains a setup script that installs and configures the required tools. If you installed these tools in another embedded device quickstart, you don't need to do it again.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup script installs the following tools:
> * [CMake](https://cmake.org): Build
> * [ARM GCC](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm): Compile
> * [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm): Monitor serial port output for connected devices

To install the tools:

1. From File Explorer, navigate to the following path in the repo and run the setup script named *get-toolchain.bat*:

    *getting-started\tools\get-toolchain.bat*

1. After the installation, open a new console window to recognize the configuration changes made by the setup script. Use this console to complete the remaining programming tasks in the quickstart. You can use Windows CMD, PowerShell, or Git Bash for Windows.
1. Run the following code to confirm that CMake version 3.14 or later is installed.

    ```shell
    cmake --version
    ```

[!INCLUDE [iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device](../../includes/iot-develop-embedded-create-central-app-with-device.md)]

## Prepare the device

To connect the NXP EVK to Azure, you'll modify a configuration file for Wi-Fi and Azure IoT settings, rebuild the image, and flash the image to the device.

### Add configuration

1. Open the following file in a text editor:

    *getting-started\NXP\MIMXRT1050-EVKB\app\azure_config.h*

1. Set the Azure IoT device information constants to the values that you saved after you created Azure resources.

    |Constant name|Value|
    |-------------|-----|
    |`IOT_DPS_ID_SCOPE` |{*Your ID scope value*}|
    |`IOT_DPS_REGISTRATION_ID` |{*Your Device ID value*}|
    |`IOT_DEVICE_SAS_KEY` |{*Your Primary key value*}|

1. Save and close the file.

### Build the image

1. In your console or in File Explorer, run the script *rebuild.bat* at the following path to build the image:

    *getting-started\NXP\MIMXRT1050-EVKB\tools\rebuild.bat*

2. After the build completes, confirm that the binary file was created in the following path:

    *getting-started\NXP\MIMXRT1050-EVKB\build\app\mimxrt1050_azure_iot.bin*

### Flash the image

1. On the NXP EVK, locate the **Reset** button, the Micro USB port, and the Ethernet port. You use these components in the following steps. All three are highlighted in the following picture:

1. Connect the Micro USB cable to the Micro USB port on the NXP EVK, and then connect it to your computer. After the device powers up, a solid green LED shows the power status.
1. Use the Ethernet cable to connect the NXP EVK to an Ethernet port.
1. In File Explorer, find the binary file that you created in the previous section.
1. Copy the binary file *mimxrt1050_azure_iot.bin*
1. In File Explorer, find the NXP EVK device connected to your computer. The device appears as a drive on your system with the drive label **RT1050-EVK**.
1. Paste the binary file into the root folder of the NXP EVK. Flashing starts automatically and completes in a few seconds.

    > [!NOTE]
    > During the flashing process, a red LED blinks rapidly on the NXP EVK.

### Confirm device connection details

You can use the **Termite** app to monitor communication and confirm that your device is set up correctly.

1. Start **Termite**.
    > [!TIP]
    > If you have issues getting your device to initialize or connect after flashing, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-embedded-device-quickstarts.md).
1. Select **Settings**.
1. In the **Serial port settings** dialog, check the following settings and update if needed:
    * **Baud rate**: 115,200
    * **Port**: The port that your NXP EVK is connected to. If there are multiple port options in the dropdown, you can find the correct port to use. Open Windows **Device Manager**, and view **Ports** to identify which port to use.
