#    Entity Linking cognitive skill

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This skill is currently in public preview. Preview functionality is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). There is currently no portal or .NET SDK support.

The **Entity Linking** skill extracts linked entities from text. This skill uses the machine learning models provided by [Text Analytics](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview.md) in Cognitive Services.

> [!NOTE]
> As you expand scope by increasing the frequency of processing, adding more documents, or adding more AI algorithms, you will need to [attach a billable Cognitive Services resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md). Charges accrue when calling APIs in Cognitive Services, and for image extraction as part of the document-cracking stage in Azure Cognitive Search. There are no charges for text extraction from documents.
>
> Execution of built-in skills is charged at the existing [Cognitive Services pay-as-you go price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/). Image extraction pricing is described on the [Azure Cognitive Search pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/).

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.V3.EntityLinkingSkill

## Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 50,000 characters as measured by [`String.Length`](/dotnet/api/system.string.length). If you need to break up your data before sending it to the EntityLinking skill, consider using the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md).

## Skill parameters

Parameter names are case-sensitive and are all optional.

| Parameter name     | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `defaultLanguageCode` |    Language code of the input text. If the default language code is not specified,  English (en) will be used as the default language code. <br/> See [Full list of supported languages](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/language-support.md). |
| `minimumPrecision` | A value between 0 and 1. If the confidence score (in the `entities` output) is lower than this value, the entity is not returned. The default is 0. |
| `modelVersion` | (Optional) The version of the model to use when calling the Text Analytics service. It will default to the latest available when not specified. We recommend you do not specify this value unless absolutely necessary. See [Model versioning in the Text Analytics API](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/concepts/model-versioning.md) for more details.|


## Skill inputs

| Input name      | Description                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `languageCode`    | A string indicating the language of the records. If this parameter is not specified, the default language code will be used to analyze the records. <br/>See [Full list of supported languages](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/language-support.md). |
| `text`          | The text to analyze.          |

## Skill outputs


| Output name      | Description                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `entities` | An array of complex types that contains the following fields: <ul><li>name (The actual entity name as it appears in the text)</li> <li>id </li> <li>language (The language of the text as determined by the skill)</li> <li>url (The linked url to this entity)</li> <li>bingId (The bingId for this linked entity)</li> <li>dataSource (The data source associated with the url) </li> <li>matches (An array of complex types that contains: `text`, `offset`, `length` and `confidenceScore`)</li></ul>|


##    Sample definition

```json
  {
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Text.V3.EntityLinkingSkill",
    "context": "/document",
    "defaultLanguageCode": "en", 
    "minimumPrecision": 0.5, 
    "inputs": [
        {
            "name": "text", 
            "source": "/document/content"
        },
        {
            "name": "languageCode", 
            "source": "/document/language"
        }
    ],
    "outputs": [
        {
            "name": "entities", 
            "targetName": "entities" 
        }
    ]
}
```
##    Sample input

```json
{
    "values": [
      {
        "recordId": "1",
        "data":
           {
             "text": "Microsoft is liked by many.",
             "languageCode": "en"
           }
      }
    ]
}
```

##    Sample output

```json
{
  "values": [
    {
      "recordId": "1",
      "data" : 
      {
        "entities": [
          {
            "name": "Microsoft", 
            "id": "Microsoft",
            "language": "en", 
            "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", 
            "bingId": "a093e9b9-90f5-a3d5-c4b8-5855e1b01f85", 
            "dataSource": "Wikipedia", 
            "matches": [
                {
                    "text": "Microsoft", 
                    "offset": 0, 
                    "length": 9, 
                    "confidenceScore": 0.13 
                }
            ]
          }
        ],
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the offsets returned for entities in the output of this skill are directly returned from the [Text Analytics API](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview.md), which means if you are using them to index into the original string, you should use the [StringInfo](/dotnet/api/system.globalization.stringinfo) class in .NET in order to extract the correct content.  [More details can be found here.](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/concepts/text-offsets.md)

## Warning cases
If the language code for the document is unsupported, a warning is returned and no entities are extracted.
