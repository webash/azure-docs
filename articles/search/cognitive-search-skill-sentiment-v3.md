# Sentiment cognitive skill (V3)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This skill is currently in public preview. Preview functionality is provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). There is currently no portal or .NET SDK support.

The V3 **Sentiment** skill evaluates unstructured text and for each record, provides sentiment labels (such as "negative", "neutral" and "positive") based on the highest confidence score found by the service at a sentence and document-level. This skill uses the machine learning models provided by version 3 of [Text Analytics](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview.md) in Cognitive Services.

> [!NOTE]
> As you expand scope by increasing the frequency of processing, adding more documents, or adding more AI algorithms, you will need to [attach a billable Cognitive Services resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md). Charges accrue when calling APIs in Cognitive Services, and for image extraction as part of the document-cracking stage in Azure Cognitive Search. There are no charges for text extraction from documents.
>
> Execution of built-in skills is charged at the existing [Cognitive Services pay-as-you go price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/). Image extraction pricing is described on the [Azure Cognitive Search pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/).


## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.V3.SentimentSkill

## Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 5000 characters as measured by [`String.Length`](/dotnet/api/system.string.length). If you need to break up your data before sending it to the sentiment skill, use the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md).

## Skill parameters

Parameters are case-sensitive.

| Parameter Name | Description |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `defaultLanguageCode` | (optional) The language code to apply to documents that don't specify language explicitly. <br/> See [Full list of supported languages](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/language-support.md) |
| `modelVersion`   | (optional) The version of the model to use when calling the Text Analytics service. It will default to the most recent version when not specified. We recommend you do not specify this value unless absolutely necessary. See [Model versioning in the Text Analytics API](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/concepts/model-versioning.md) for more details. |
| `includeOpinionMining` | If set to `true`, enables [the opinion mining feature of TextAnalytics](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-sentiment-analysis.md#opinion-mining), which allows aspect-based sentiment analysis to be included in your output results. Defaults to `false`. |

## Skill inputs 

| Input	Name | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `text` | The text to be analyzed.|
| `languageCode`	|  (optional) A string indicating the language of the records. If this parameter is not specified, the default value is "en". <br/>See [Full list of supported languages](../cognitive-services/text-analytics/language-support.md).|

## Skill outputs

| Output	Name | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `sentiment` | A string value that represents the sentiment label of the entire analyzed text (either positive, neutral or negative). |
| `confidenceScores` | A complex type with three double values, one for the positive rating, one for the neutral rating, and one for the negative rating. Values range from 0 to 1.00, where 1.00 represents the highest possible confidence in a given label assignment. |
| `sentences` | A collection of complex types that breaks down the sentiment of the text sentence by sentence. This is also where opinion mining results are returned in the form of targets and assessments if `includeOpinionMining` is set to `true`.|
